## Sample 1: On Truth and Words

May these words be a catalyst for your own truth. Support for your own insight, which are too subtle and too precise to be put into words.

Truth cannot be written. I can only be read, for it is the wind off the reader, the mind & the care for observer, who creates it.

The sun has risen. Another day begins. Anyone can describe the sun, but only your energetic presence can feel it on your skin. Spiritually is present that religions can only write about.

## Sample 2: On Intellect and Mind

How the intellect can skew your attention away from the real world of the senses, and into one story after another, which elicit emotions and more stories.... Many of which are nested story inside story, belief inside belief.

Buddhism is a science of consciousness. By rising, the "Middle Path" it does away with opinions, bias, concepts, memories and overcomes the intellect. For intellect, Buddhism says that even the most inspired and profound stories can only point the intellect in a direction - the deeper meaning only appears when the mind ceases its grasping the platitudes, the clutches, the caddy us he clogs of the intellect.

The intellect exists because the mind wants to know what other people know. Go into other people as. Into because the intellect turns reifying for the mind as it's heard we Buddhists can understand that to really know how people, to know the self would be to know it in the mind, without words.

The intellect turns the world up meaning and the mind upside down. That is what makes it so powerful. That's what makes it so deceptive. The mind has intellect is built on doesn't need to "understand" anything. To understand something in the sense I mean this is to be able to explain it in words. What we meaning next to the sheer experience of the mind. And the intellect is the mind's organ, it's tool for translating words, sentences, symbolic logic at all types of information (new, auditory, evolutionary tactics) into meaning for the mind. That's the emotional reactor machine.

With every tool we gain, we lose a skill, the minds forgot how not to fall into the intellect. It is so useful. It is so compelling. That the only way to make sure is it history and history seems to be all anyone else is talking about. And I have a responsibility to My history. My history is my story.

It's easy to think of history as The story. like there is only one history. But really, there are as many histories as there are people. The history that appears in books, in Google, in university classrooms and in board rooms, these don't exist real entities. there have no pulse, they can be measured, no brain waves, No body No mind. Using the word history, invokes an idea of what this history looks like. From the most intellect of a particular reader.

Most of the time most people (it looks to me from here.) Can't see their own intellect. or recognize that history is a story they are making up as they go along, based on choice. Their people's (only their own choice) throwing in their face!

Buddhism is a way to stop body from the intellect. recognize the intellect as the tool that it is. Note what can be gained by it, but note very carefully what is sacrificed to create it. A sacrifice it in the mind at the time.

## Sample 3: Campfire Reflections - June 6, 2025

The open question I would like to now address is whether either formal or informal systems can be used to express models of "the world."

I am writing in my notebook, sitting beside a campfire which I built in a large metal fire pit, in my campsite in a redwood forest in Northern California. In the context of models of the world, the building and maintaining of a fire safely requires a model of what a fire is, what it needs to be maintained, and how it can be maintained safely, so the fire does not spread to the delicate and vulnerable forest all around me.

To categorize this model—an idea or perhaps understood as a set of ideas which together constitute a model—it includes both scientific principles like combustion (chemistry), material science (wood, paper, air), fluid science (airflow), thermodynamics (temperature), even gravity (cold air is heavier than warm air, gravity creating lift in response to heating), with the possibilities of embers being carried on currents out of the pit into the forest.

Beyond the science, the actions I take to build, maintain, and control the fire are engineering. With intention, I am finding and judging twigs to start the fire, feeding last night's coals to maintain the fire, judging whether I need to add a fresh piece of the wood bundle I bought to keep the fire going without making it too large. I'm also judging how close I can sit to have the smoke of the fire drive away the mosquitoes, but not so close that the smoke irritates my eyes, as I continue writing about these ideas in my notebook.

As a writer, I like to imagine my thoughts are the same as the words on the page I've just written. I aspire to capture the important points: the essence of the intention which motivated me to pick up the pen and paper and start jotting down letters to form words, sentences, paragraphs—yet on reflection, I recognize that the thoughts I have while writing are far more varied, even scattered, than the words that I carefully form on the page. Further, as I re-read the words I've been writing, my thoughts change, my ideas develop. I think of examples which I'd like to include, concepts which may help explain, and ambiguity and misleading phrases which may distract from one critical point or another that I am aspiring to make crystal clear.

Has the subject of my writing changed? Has the topic evolved? Well, it depends on what I mean by those words. I want to consider, in this writing session, the nature of narrative—informal or formal—and whether such a form is able to articulate a model of the world.

## Sample 4: On Narrative Limits

I've sat here next to my little fire, looking at the end of that last sentence, considering where to go next, clearly, to me, narrative is inadequate to convey or "create" comprehensive models of "the world"—whether internal models of a subjective world, conceptual models of an objective world, or a model of a corporeal world to which we are causally connected. It is inadequate to record a comprehensive, personal account of such a model, and demonstrably more inadequate to convey such a model to a different person or some other type of being. Yet it is literally all we have, and from a practical viewpoint it does convey many practical ideas in many useful categories. While not purely scientific, the practical engineering that can be codified in formal and informal ways have bestowed untold power on human beings going back some millions of years… including tools like fire, and much more recently, writing.

So maybe the serial narrative does have important utility… just perfection in translation from ideas and absolute modeling of corporeality is not available as such. I would note, in that case, that the problem with the serial narrative form is not in the narrative, but in the belief that expressions are more than the utility that they bestow; that the meaning they evoke is something which can be "true" in any absolute sense. Rather, at best, narrative is useful, now.

## Sample 5: A Guide to the Subjective World - June 30, 2025

A Guide to the Subjective World
A written roadmap to
the Algorithms of Text
Through Agency.

There are many subjects, but there is only one you, the person reading these words and understanding them. My goal in these pages is to help you, the person reading, understand your perspective on the world as built from some conditions of Being: Agency, Awareness, Belief, Models described in text, and Judgments.

This is not a description of a Being living in a corporeal world. Ideally the specifics of the subject are essentially unknown and unknowable by any Being other than the Subject Being, which is always only you.

Being is just what it is to be you, moment to moment. Exactly that, nothing more. In this sense, Being, as the verb of "To Be," it is the "is" ing the "is."

Subjects exist in corporeal packages, and could be anything, but it must be something interacting with a surrounding corporeal world with presumably other corporeal Beings which can interact through some corporeal medium.

The focus of this guide is a phenomenological investigation and guide to the structure of Being a Being, with a body, with agency in a world of interactions among many levels of Being, tuning in to a specific perspective on all of the ways we are focusing on stories and judgments—or "banter"—that distort a subject's a balanced awareness of, specifically, the limits to the usefulness of text and how a bias towards distortion (deconstruction) is its only utility.

The only assumption I make is that we can understand the words you are reading.

## Sample 6: Text as Sense Organ

As a reading subject, text adds not only the field of a new sensory domain of how much attention there is in the brain to recognize and understand words and symbols of other recognizable signs—it also brings a new kind of time, since text is dealing with content that happened or is scheduled to happen at almost any time but "now." This is the clear distinction with all of the other senses, which are all composited together in our awareness of Now as what our senses show us is what the world seems like at the moment, and who I am now, it is the time it takes to notice what Now is.

An understanding of Text as an additional sense organ makes it clear to me that text is changed into a deeper, integrated experience of a truth about each serially experienced text encounter and as the meaning of the new encounter is evoked by the reading, the present state of Being is, as a whole, recalibrated, even if only very slightly.

The actual text of anything is like the photon. It carries an experience to the reader, but the reader must evoke what it means, and it will always an experience which only manifests in the context of one specific subject at a time. This is a guide for the subjects.
