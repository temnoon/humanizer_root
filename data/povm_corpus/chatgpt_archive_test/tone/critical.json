The objective world is at most (ontologically) the idea of one or more physical beings. ",

The `sanitizeInput` function removes any non-word or non-whitespace characters from the input, while the `tokenizeInput` function uses the `natural` library's `WordTokenizer` to tokenize the input.\n\nThe `prepareInputForGPT3` function uses both `sanitizeInput` and `tokenizeInput` to prepare the input for sending to the GPT-3 API. It returns an object with two properties: `prompt`, which is the concatenated, sanitized, and tokenized input, and `max_tokens`, which is the number of tokens in the input.\n\nFinally, the code defines a `userInput` variable, calls `prepareInputForGPT3` on it, and logs the result, which is the object prepared for sending to the GPT-3 API.",

At the center, a tiger\u2019s face merges seamlessly with the swirling, dreamlike surroundings, symbolizing the guiding force of a guru. The tiger's eyes are depicted with a depth that conveys wisdom and a grasp that is both literal and metaphorical. Adjacent to this central figure is an eye with a luminous pupil, radiating light along a path, representing the eye of knowledge and the individual\u2019s journey towards self-realization. This path meanders through a landscape of surreal waves and celestial bodies, evoking a sense of moving beyond the physical realm towards a state of release. The colors are warm and radiant, suggesting a serene but powerful progression towards enlightenment. The atmosphere of the image is one of profound tranquility, emphasizing the personal effort required to achieve spiritual liberation.",
