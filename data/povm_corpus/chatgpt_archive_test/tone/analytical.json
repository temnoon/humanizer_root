At the center, the 'Start' point is marked, signifying the Planck level. The spiral extends outward in a clockwise direction, with each radial segment denoting a different academic discipline such as 'Cosmological', 'Geological', 'Ecology', 'Sociology', 'Biology', and 'Chemistry'. Each discipline is placed along the spiral path in a sequence, with circled 'Q' notations and superscript numbers marking the levels from Q\u2070 to Q\u2078. The use of color gradients beautifully illustrates the progression and interconnectivity of the fields, implying a foundational relationship between them, all anchored to the central Planck level. The overall design captures the essence of interdisciplinary study and the conceptual mapping of knowledge from fundamental physics to more complex systems.",
