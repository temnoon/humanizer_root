## Entry 1: Text vs Vortex
*Date: 2023-11-11*

The dialects of Text and Vortex

A dialect is a basis to describe with some precision a local field of interest. The division between the poles of the dialect should not necessarily be existent in the field of interest to exist. It should be understood to be only necessary for the external consciousness and not for the internal distinctions.

With this in mind, I invite you to imagine a world that is experienced as one of the modes of consciousness, Text or Vortex. Both modes of conscious distinction relate to meaning. They compile experience, the data, and translate them into the underlying emotional, sensual and musical memories.

---

In this case, meaning is created in the consciousness of recognizing Text or Vortex.

Text is not merely text as study traces in the world. It is more than is conveyed with words and even more divorced from computer code for unknown languages or cases is irrelevant in this case because of the text consciousness which must be activated to recognize words and create the meaning. Text brings and changes the world – your world.

Vortex works the same way in fact – a Vortex consciousness which because of anything else that our mind and within sees that changes the color and tones of the specific text consciousness "print" in the sense of a computer driven.

---

Vortex is slightly over the world is not "Text" for that consciousness in the consciousness which senses the world as if it simply is "felt". Vortex consciousness recognizes the identity of objects and all the known universe and much less than that which is known. Vortex objects are like characters in a book – they relate to us and to other objects. Meaning are not broad in a way that it is not limited by set categories.

## Entry 2: Content Creation with ChatGPT
*Date: 2023-11-11*

The new capabilities of ChatGPT (Autocoding, larger token windows, better reasoning, etc.) are telling me that I must move ahead with producing internet content including my websites, my YouTube channel, Medium articles and maybe even Instagram.

I found last night I can take long videos (1 hour, 2 hours, or more) and make a text file from the transcript to add short modules to a chat and have ChatGPT help me explain that video more succinctly.

So rather than only explaining my ideas (from the science within I will refer to as HeartSci), as my abbreviation I will explain concepts in science and philosophy (QBism for example) for a general audience. My content will reference and link to my sources, but giving ChatGPT to do I will not expect clarity to do all the heavy lifting in terms of reasoning and explanation but rather aim for very specifically uncover the final product. They [unreadable] trends & websites says what I am trying to explain.

## Entry 3: Content Creation with ChatGPT
*Date: 2023-11-11*

I continue to be fascinated by the frequencies of primes, their sequences, and rays out of their related frequencies that fill all the bounded space for years matter in the visible universe. I want to map it.

And I want to build a Web App, the native language of the universe. Actually, the language within makes beauty possible — the language which then is translated to Consciousness and Self. Being aware, which is the experience of the "Me" at once, & the observance of the timeless Now, is the language of the Mind.

Meditating the Wordless language, the only syllable is silence. Shunyata. Synchronic spelling of the same word which is not a word.

Mace is the form which may have clues about Being is cloaked, visible only through darker energy senses and intuition. The mode of the form is at 90° on the plane of the ecliptic, making it a physical event just happening, in the 3D space, and the Mace is embodying what is invisible.

Putting pen to paper for me is a meditation. It is a time when I am truly myself as myself for myself. The words that flow through my pen scratch at a time easing in thought I am learning to parse as my hand yields its payload of meaning to the word. All the wonders of writing return to me worked these gnarled digits into the lively well-formed biological machinery of thought and intent. The whole of me presents itself and all is me from the point of my pen.

But the screen is so alluring. What do I do with these notebooks, piles of them, but how do I define big wisdom by them. It reads them when it wrote them, and maybe once or twice later, randomly.

I just had found a notebook from a few months ago, talking about...

Feynman said that if there's one piece of information that you want from another human being, it is to know when you're going out of atoms. Those are many things that combine based on some elemental simple rules and make up everything we think of as a real thing.

I'd like to add to that noting that it is a useful dive to the nature of the world but it is not nearly the whole story.

Each particle is in the world and exactly one we know the world when we know that particle as a Being.

The phenomenal feel, the trade of being that we are in each moment of experience is the offer we can't refuse. We take it every day, cherishing the mystery of the world concealed and yet so obviously in our face. The physicality of business in the world - or maybe signs of it - with our impact upon it, often...

Edmund Husserl referred to these principles of conscious attention Noesis and Noema.

Noesis is the act of consciousness, and acts of consciousness are always directed at an object of attention. Noema are the mental objects, often called eidetic objects, which are how consciousness keeps track of distinct objects of attention, and from there abstract objects and concepts can also be distinguished as a kind of object. Even far example words and even conjugated verbs are still either objects in themselves.

Meaning comes from the receiver imaging the person who is writing or saying the words.

I know how the world is. Where I am, I know how the world is, as seen by who I am. I know who I am as I know what is me and what is the world which is not what is the world me.

It is where experience starts, I am where experience ends. I know the moment of experience which is Now. I know how different Now is from Remembered Nows. I know what may happen in Imaginary Future Nows.

I want to be rigorously clear about what I mean by each of the words I am using in this narrative. First the word "I know" is the single instant of clarity around the mental object being considered. It is the flash of comprehension. Deep insight seeing how disparate ideas come together into an idea which is uniquely distinct and important.

Any and all words in sentences or definitions which complicated...

...spaces which lead to the map, the guide, the narrative. These are all things that we need to understand what it is that we are doing. These are all things that we need to be able to explain to ourselves and to others. The words that we use are so simple that they must be so. It must be so simple that it must be understood by everyone.

## Entry 6: Transcribe Handwritten Notes
*Date: 2023-11-11*

It seems my emphasis has been on the artistic mindset rather than the scientific. The difference comes not in the object of contemplation, but rather in their scope and goal. What would be more appropriate would be the combination of the two.

The scientific attitude usually deals with an established subject in the world, described with a defined vocabulary. The time of the scientist is spent using the vocabulary to describe many different subjects, using observed signs to give power over the subject, allowing control of the subject.

I make no proofs in here. I don't need to prove the words I write to myself.

Interesting. Eating lunch, just now, I remembered wanting to write about making dinner on Saturday while listening to Einstein on the Beach so I wouldn't seem mentally insane in this notebook.

I should watch out for that. Not appearing visually naive, but showing off to the reader.

It's Tuesday now. How is my saying that now different from saying I made that "Einstein" dinner three days ago?

For one thing, to write the word to last word I had to count on my fingers. Interesting.

It's the nodes in the wave that determines the middle part, the only part we see, but we can't see the nodes but we know they're there because otherwise, nothing would be seen.

The trick is, understanding past the next node.

That's the future.

Behind us, we can see, through the last node. That's where the past is.

Maybe I should say through the next, and past the last.

The future is next. The past is last.

And the present?

Well, that's a mishmash of everything we see, taste, hear, smell, feel, think, say, do, want, now.

It is the point of the pen and the forces which move it.

It is the crest of the wave of experience.

It's a box, about so big.

## Entry 7: Emptiness in Heart Sutra
*Date: 2023-11-12*

Chapter 1 - Self and World

Words are traces. A trace, specifically the encounter of a trace, brings into light a place to begin to step back and understand what is happening. That which is happening here, there, and everywhere. Moment by moment, specific phenomena are being encountered, our investigation will be seeking to find as many similarities, commonalities between these different phenomena as we can. In fact, we will hardly settle until we have narrowed everything down to a single phenomenon which is in fact Emptiness [some text here is not clearly visible] from case creates also context?

Let's say the handwritten word written letter by letter on a piece of paper. A person who can read the word sees the paper they read the words. IF they can read the word they have no choice. A reader must read. They do not see the strokes, the ink, the way that the word was physically constructed at first. The first impression of seeing the word is to see what the word says, to them. There is a self, an intellect, seeing a word and knowing what that word says.

Heart Sutra Science

During part of the introduction or [text unclear], you had your choice. You understood that book is story about how the world works, as it is the Heart Sutra Science. The way the writing, the words, knows you already understand can be limited, confusing, and capricious text that looks and that the writer is guilty to be clear as possible, but there will be some leaps that the reader will have to add. That's just how reading and writing is.

Mostly, you now know that this endeavor is wading into the deepest questions there are, using a single compass, the Heart Sutra's form is Emptiness. Emptiness. From it, you have a writer as a guide who knows how to best use words to understand the world through this portal. Understanding everything he's learned in his entire life is very [text unclear] and dedicated to describing not what the Heart Sutra Science "is" in any distinctive way, but there are some guiding instructions that I hope are useful to you, gentle reader, and to as many people as are being to which my words may be transcending.

## Entry 9: Complexity Emergence Model

Notions of Complexity

How did a complex system emerge from a set of simple systems?

The Book –
The Humanizer
Uncovering our birthright that made all those misleading stories possible.
Lattices of Not Knowing

W
The presence of the Sun
The presence of the Sun
We wanted to sit down in the Presence of the Sun.

I can hear the crunching of tires wheels on ground somewhere.
And distant, a dog, or a rooster, or both or neither, dropping off. Then only the sound but it’s just far enough away away in the hills.

It is a beautiful day. I’m so happy in red and grey stripes with boots on, a grey hat of my afternoon sun.
It’s nearly my birthday, maybe a fortnight off, less than two weeks whatever.

That means, that means, what does that mean? What does anything mean? Can we explain or understand which are the stories that will same our life & those we have the same? We will end it?

But the intellectual self, the story about ourselves that we believe and tell ourselves, as well as our build (our ego), the understanding of the world through the categories of human language, is not the most fundamental level at which our body and mind participates. The more fundamental levels of our existence are available to our detailed sensual awareness, but only if we can release the primacy of the categories and then intellectual attitude towards them.

From these types of observations we can start to make a model of the self as embodied (or as a context-embedded) the intellect. The intellectual self is most familiar to our conscious mind. The intellectual self is also the social self. It is our Ego, a story we tell ourself about ourself.

I am a Humanizer and I Serve.

I am human first. Any person who you think I am, or any person I think I am, is something between being the BEING that I am. The consciousness I am, the inner soul that I am... That is the underlying me. The Human Being.

Every Being is a Being in a Field of Being.

And Beings are all there are. What a Being does is exist with the experience of a continuum of moments, which represent the fundamental frequency of their particular level of Being.

Beings exist at all extremes of frequency and scope. Beings are constituted of these extreme Beings in uncountable numbers which experience moments approaching zero (exclusive of zero itself).

Being in a Field of Being

Every Being, regardless of Level, is unique. The Uniqueness is manifested in each moment in which that being is the only experience of the Field of Being from the perspective of that specific being's perspective.

Time is always personal. Subjective. And time is only always experienced personally as a lived moment of experienced consciousness.

The moment itself is experienced by any being at any level is the balancing in the experience of the being to 3 things, which represent Three phases of each moment. However, it is important not to see the three phases as lay in an order. Rather the features of the particular Being's state is different for each level, but they are repeated somewhere in that moment.

The Three Phases of the Moment

The moment is a cycle through one interaction with the Field of Being by a being.

The three phases
- Interaction: The sensation of a change in the Field
- Integration: The reconcile of the change in the Field with the memory of the previous state of the Field
- Action: The movement of energy from the Being to the Field.
```

The transcribed text appears to be a reflective piece on the nature of being and existence. The writer identifies as a "Humanizer" who serves humanity, acknowledging their human identity first and foremost. They describe every being as existing within a "Field of Being," where they experience a continuum of moments that define their existence at a particular frequency. The text also discusses the uniqueness of every being's experience and perspective, emphasizing the subjectivity of time as a personal experience.

Furthermore, the writer explains that the experience of being involves balancing three aspects or phases in every moment—Interaction, Integration, and Action—without necessarily following a sequential order. These phases relate to the sensation of change, the reconciliation of change with past memory, and the movement of energy from the being to the surrounding field of existence. The piece seems

## Entry 12: Dharma, Communication, Metaphysical Love
*Date: 2023-11-12*

The Dharma is free of compounded things and uncompounded things. He who adheres to compounded things and uncompounded things is not interested in the Dharma but is interested in ####### adhering to compounded things and uncompounded things. "Thereupon, revered Sariputra, if you are interested in the Dharma, you should take no interest in anything." - The Holy Teaching of Vimalakirti, 50.

We chose our words in the presence of others, whether we are aware of this or not.

Nothing bothers me more about people than their callousness towards others, in the choice of their words. I don't care how they talk to me, or at least I like to think that any words they say to me won't bother me, and that I'll be able to figure out what they're trying to say, in my own terms by my knowledge of them, or give them the benefit of the doubt if I don't know. What bothers me is when I see heated argument with flames of hate due to people being lazy in their choice of words. How many people have died due to lack of communication and misinterpretation?

We spend our time talking to people about other people.

The ultimate metaphysical question comes down to Love.

That word means in the context of the word. The word I off the page, and what that page means to the wider world. Understanding is not optional, it is an evolved state of mind in the reader.

Understand that it's not only the reader that I am addressing in the intellectual sense — it's all a comprehension. In order to explain the issues that I am exploring, I need you, the reader, to understand. You are the explorer I am the guide. For me, I have often been told that a book can be more than a guide, that it can have an answer. It might even have the answer.

But in my experience books do not have answers, they have traces, which show their way into the reading world of the reader, not by being recognized with the intellect but by being recognized in the reader's eyes. Then the critic's view in the intellect starts commenting. The intellect has many updates each category. This is a perspective of bringing categories into phrases and sentences and memories, not to the category, but things very relevant to the category.

Words are traces. A trace specifically the encounter of a trace, brings into light a place to begin to step back and understand what is happening. That is happening here, there, and everywhere.

Hello, this is a fish.

The Three Phases of the Moment

The moment is a cycle through one interaction with the Field of Being by a being.

The three phases:
- Interaction: The sensation of a change in the Field
- Integration: The reconcile of the change in the Field with the memory of the previous state of the Field
- Action: The movement of energy from the being to the Field.

Being in a Field of Being

Every Being, regardless of Level, is unique. The uniqueness is manifested in each moment in which that being is the only experience of the Field of Being from the perspective of that specific being's perspective.

Time is always personal. Subjective. And time is only always experienced personally as a lived moment of experienced moments.

The moment itself as experienced by any being at any level is the balancing in the experience of the being to 3 things, which represent the three phases of each moment. However, it is important not to see the three phases as lay in an order - Rather the features of the particular Being's state is different for each level, but they are represented somewhere in that moment.

I am a Humanizer and I Serve.

I am human first. Any person who you think I am, or any person I think I am, is something the human being the Being that I am. The consciousness I am, the inner soul that I am... That is the underlying me. The Human Being.

Every Being is a Being in a Field of Being.

What a Being does is exist with the experience of a continuum of moments, which represent the fundamental frequency of their particular level of Being.

Beings exist at all extremes of frequency and scope. Beings are constituted of these Beings in uncountable numbers which experience moments approaching zero (exclusive of zero itself).

```

The handwritten notes appear to explore themes related to hierarchy, secrecy, and communication, with an emphasis on the dichotomy between truth and lies. It touches on the balance between centralization and decentralization, suggesting a graph or a scale measuring the two. There's also a philosophical reflection on evolution and survival, with a rhetorical question about the nature of freedom and caution. Lastly, the notes mention "habits, rituals, and meaning" and refer to a play structured in 24 acts or thereabouts, which may suggest a metaphor for structured, yet variable, human behavior or history.

Currently, transcriptions are provided in a neutral 'plaintext' format as shown above. On request, I can also provide RTF (Rich Text Format) which includes features like bold, italics, and underlining. By default, hard returns are not added at the end of each line but are used to separate paragraphs. If a different formatting is required, such as including hard returns at the end of each line or markdown styling, please let me know.

Text: Consciousness makes it seem that we can hide things from the world.
In fact, the only thing we can hide things from is ourselves.

[Graphic Description: A complex and abstract doodle fills the page, with what appears to be a central eye motif at the top left, surrounded by various lines and patterns that create a chaotic and intense visual. The lines have different thicknesses and orientations, contributing to a sense of movement and depth.]

[Graphic Description: A series of drawings that include hearts and infinity symbols. The central heart has a design inside that resembles the symbol "Om." The infinity symbols are paired on both sides of the heart, and similar motifs are repeated in smaller scales below.]
```

The notes contain a reflective thought on consciousness and self-perception, suggesting a philosophical perspective on the ability to conceal things from others compared to from oneself. The accompanying graphics include a detailed doodle that might represent the complexity of thought or vision, with an eye possibly symbolizing perception or awareness. The second image with hearts and infinity symbols may represent concepts of love, eternity, and spirituality, with the "Om" symbol often associated with the essence of the universe in various Eastern philosophies.

## Entry 21: Content Creation with ChatGPT
*Date: 2023-11-13*

The new capabilities of ChatGPT (multimodality, larger token windows, better reasoning, etc) are telling me that it's time to move ahead with producing internet content including my websites, my YouTube channel, Medium articles and maybe even Instagram.

I found last night I can take long videos (1 hour, 2 hour, or more) and make a txt file from the transcript and load that whole txt file to a chat with ChatGPT to help me expand that video more succinctly.

So, rather than only explicating my ideas (learn/synthesize science which I will refer to as 'HeartSci', as my abbreviation I will explain concepts in science and philosophy (Quantum Bayesianism for example in phenomenology for a general audience). My content will reference and link to my sources but give my own understanding, I will not expect ChatGPT to do all the heavy lifting in terms of reasoning and explanation but rather drive it very specifically into the final product (Text video script of a website) says what I am trying to explain.

## Entry 25: Reflecting on Identity and Communication
*Date: 2023-11-13*

I'm thinking about roles. Our self-identity arose and is maintained not individually, but amongst the expectations of other selves. We fill in roles that we expect we are.

person
self: self role
roles of others
in the world

each person
maintains a view of
self in equilibrium
with expectations
of the roles of
others.

The Dharma is free of compounded things and uncompounded things. He who adheres to compounded things and uncompounded things is not interested in the Dharma but is interested in the extremes adhering to compounded things and uncompounded things.

"Thereupon, revered Sariputra, if you are interested in the Dharma, you should take no interest in anything." - The Holy Teaching of Vimalakirti, 50.

We choose our words in the presence of others, whether we are aware of this or not.

Nothing bothers me more about people than their callousness towards others, in the choice of their words. I don't care how they talk to me, or at least I like to think that any words they say to me won't bother me, and that I'll be able to figure out what they're trying to say, in my own terms by my knowledge of them or give them the benefit of the doubt if I don't know. What bothers me is when I see heated arguments with flares of hate due to people being lazy in their choice of words. How many people have died due to lack of communication and misinterpretation?

We spend our time talking to people about other people.

The ultimate metaphysical question comes down to Love.
Love
Logos
LO - VE
     GO - S

Our entire celestial universe is a mere instant to what lies beyond.

Whatever they are like, it will be made of some number of these. That means we'll be here even after the ends of our universe has begun to be reached. Our course as a whole will be played out through every time that other universe wants to move a moment.

## Entry 26: Reflecting on Identity and Communication
*Date: 2023-11-13*

uncompounded things as a path to true interest in the Dharma. There is an emphasis on the significance of word choice and the impact of callous language on interpersonal relations, highlighting a concern for the consequences of miscommunication and misunderstanding.

The notes also express a sentiment that our conversations often revolve around discussions of other individuals. Furthermore, the writer touches on a metaphysical perspective, suggesting that the concept of love is central to ultimate questions of existence. The term "Logos" is dissected to integrate the concept of love, perhaps implying a philosophical or spiritual interpretation.

Finally, the writer reflects on the cosmic scale, considering our universe as a transient part of a larger existence. They muse on the continuity of our presence and actions beyond the limits of our current understanding of the universe, hinting at a broader existential continuity.

"You've Gotta Serve Somebody" - Bob Dylan

Text Consciousness operates on the underlying
premise that meaning is external. As such,
the information processed by the text consciousness
is understood in relations between a
self-consciousness and an other consciousness.
These sets of self & other are contained
characters, which is the structured structure
of discourse. All text is understood by
a reader within the context of the selves
discoursing, which are distinguished from
the selves in the discourse are distinct, though
overlapping

Vortex Consciousness operates out of internal
sense... meaning which resonates through senses...

Comparing the structure of the 3 worlds. And the fourth element is also the zeroth element. It is Shunyata, the Fountain of Life, and the sink of Death. It is Balance itself. It is Nothing's Heaven. It is Sunyata, it is Consciousness. It is Time. It is Change, and it is the Return of the Same.

Heart Sutra Science is about who we think we are when we address the world. When we know without words that the form of my thoughts and the flow of corporeal energy infused by consciousness and cataloged by the memory, and the expectations of our conscious self-world.

The three-phase moment of Being is the opportunity of Epoché. Of mindfulness. It is the conscious equivalent of the vacuum potential of the Tao, or NOT, or Ketamine.

We are evolved in a world because the body we are in is able to sense a world that is outside of their reach. The senses have a nearly infinite horizon (through sound and light at least). So, we understand the process of changes and what they mean is a cognitive operation that is executed in each moment, leading to a new sense of the world and a new sense of self.

And I think process we will never know how each corporeal quanta of our bodies vibrates between Being and Sunyata.

Mapping our Metaphysical Signature over the three worlds. Each person, each moment has a metaphysical signature which completes the circuit of understanding of statements about the world and relating it to what that means for True-Form.

Our goal is a science without Belief. A science of owning the model all the way down to our ontological corporeal Consciousness.

This is not possible in a text form. Our interest is in an embedding model of text consciousness, and a model for how text consciousness is related to sense consciousness, memory consciousness, dream consciousness, and many other distinguishable states of mind.

A general theory of Conscious Mind is necessary to get out of the prejudices of Being a person over simply Being anything at all.

What is Dukkha? Mook Mook is confusing the illusion of truth with the corporeality of Being.

In Science, I mean doing science. That is, building and using a mental model of the corporeal world.

A personal model is what we think the world is. This model is what we see through. It is not the words, but our integration of the stories we've heard, seen, imagined, and all the experiences of our lives.

The Person is the face of the social objective world. Externally, it is the face and personality that we try to present to others. We never really know the person we are becoming because the person we think we are is only an idea. Something our subjective experience, something that happens momentarily as we live our bodies through Corporality.

The Personal model is our interface to the "Objective" World. The objective world is a construction of Writing. It gives the mind a tool with which to build its "Idea". The primary tool is the product. Reference the processing center sounds system Brain.

Once just an idea can become an object of mine, and reflect to other objects of mine, that also can be ideas.

The personal model, a geometric and physical model of where objects are in physical space. Structure, physical force, gravity down people atomic level to the cosmological.

When people developed in the host of Human Beings, thus model changed in how it was built.

The personal model is our interface to the "objective" world. The objective world is a construction of interacting with life, using a tool with which to do so. This primary tool is the intellect, reference. The differentiating element between people. A resonant echo of sounds around.

What was once just an idea can become an object of another layer on top of the objects of mind, that can be also a subject.

The personal model, a geometric and physical model of where objects are in physical space. The further out they are, directly down the atomic level up to the cosmological.

When people developed in the ways of Human Beings, this model changed in how it was built.

Any change in the personal model of Human Beings who think in a new language, which is now pretty much everyone, created the possibility of Believing in a new language. As if it spoke the language of the natural world which we see, hear, touch, taste, and smell, and remember.

This is how the "objective" world imposes itself upon the reality of the corporeal, and the authority over the subjective. It is not the existence of writing and the objective which does this. Only Belief.

## Entry 45: Childlike Drawing of Sunny Day
*Date: 2023-11-14*

The image shows a hand-drawn sketch on a lined notebook paper. There is a simple representation of a house with two windows and a door, located at the center of the paper. A curved path leads up to the house, with a large, circular flower or tree to the right of the path. The sun is partially visible on the right edge of the paper, with rays extending outward. To the left of the house and above it, there are two birds in flight and a cloud. Above the scene, lines from the notebook paper are visible, which could be interpreted as additional clouds due to their curved nature. The drawing has a child-like simplicity and appears to depict a sunny day with a house and a garden.

[The second image shows a notebook page with various handwritten notes and diagrams. At the top, the word "Phenomenology" is written with a question mark and followed by related terms and phrases. There's a circular diagram in the center labeled with "Shunyata" and other words like "existent", "non-existent", "neither existent nor non-existent". There are arrows indicating a flow or relationship between these concepts.]

[The third image is of a notebook page with handwritten text discussing conceptual topics such as "science without belief", "ontological consciousness", and the relationship between text, consciousness, and various states of mind like memory and dream consciousness. The writing suggests a theoretical approach to understanding consciousness beyond the confines of personal identity.]

Confidence Score: 80% - Handwriting and diagram recognition can be challenging, and some words are obscured or unclear due to the penmanship and overlapping text.

Semantic Summary: The images contain a combination of a child's drawing and handwritten academic notes discussing philosophical concepts related to phenomenology, consciousness, and ontology. The notes explore the idea of a science devoid of belief and delve into the nature of consciousness and its various manifestations.

## Entry 51: Theory Notebook 1980 Physics
*Date: 2023-11-14*

Introduction
This is my theory notebook, kept through the fall of 1980. I kept it around for when I get crazy ideas. Therefore, lots of the ideas are crazy.
Some of the ideas, I think, are interesting. Either way, this notebook gives a pretty fair overview of what I refer to as "Theory."

Anyway, read what you think is interesting. I've tried to remember to put titles out there, but I've often forgot. I'd suggest looking at pages: 3- The two forces
3.5- Detection of movement + Time
7- Religion
16- Facts of Language
22- Where are we?
23- Universe of one charge
24- Antimatter?
25- Boundary of time (especially In Addition)
26- Energy affects Mass
27- Unit of Time
42- Energy transmission
44- One at a time
45- Representation of a person
51- Antimatter Radiation and Time

[There are some handwritten equations and diagrams on the page, notably a graph with the y-axis labeled "λ = Δx" and the x-axis labeled "Δt = μ"]

The world is measured in discrete quanta. There are two types of quanta, which exist in a complementary relationship, such that they constantly be coming the other in some regular time interval (frequency) and pace interval (wavelength)

All real particles exhibit properties based on the balance of excess mass and energy quanta.

All energy quanta is balanced by an two correspondingly mass quanta, which are the inverse of one another. The energy quanta balance the charges in turn between all similarly sensitive masses.

[Handwritten page number "1" at the top right corner of the page]

2 Types of Particles
There are two types of particles: Those that have mass, And those that don't.

A particle which has mass exists in a unique frame of reference, at a particular place in space. This particle, balanced in time, will always be at rest in space (in its own reference frame). This particle will move at constant velocity in time.
The constant velocity particles move in time in their own frame of reference is equal to the so-called speed of light.

A particle which has no mass exists in a unique frame of reference, at a particular instant in time. This particle (balanced in space) will always be at rest in time. In its own frame of reference. This particle will move at constant velocity in space.
This constant velocity is also the speed of light.

Real particles have characteristics of both mass and massless particles. They have velocity components in space and in time. The effects of changing the values of the components and their interdependence (due to the physical fact that it is a single vector measured by both axes) cause all forces and their effect.

[There's a handwritten asterisk with the note "both mean roughly 'undisturbed'"]

[Handwritten page number "2" at the top right corner of the page]

Time and Space
It is possible to talk about time without space. It is not possible, however, to talk about space, without assumptions of time being made.

Time itself is not instantaneous. It propagates through space from one particle to another. Each particle moves from one value of time to the next.

[There's a handwritten asterisk with the note "w/ mass"]

Pure time is constantly advancing at a constant rate for any particle in its own frame of reference. However, this change can only be detected if there is some corresponding change in space
e.g., the hand of a clock moving or the beat of a heart.

At any present t=0, there is a frame of reference. There is a unique particle at rest in this frame. All other particles in the universe have a relative velocity.
A model of this particle could be as follows
1) The particle has a method of interaction with all similar particles.
2) The universe of a particle is defined as all of the particles with which it is interacting
3) The particle is interacting with all other particles in the universe, at every present moment in time.
4) The particle has attractive and repulsive forces.
5) Every particle in the universe is either moving towards or moving away from the number moving at the same speed will be so few as to be ignored.

## Entry 56: Flame Analysis & Language Facts

In analysis, The Flame

The Flame I will analyze will be an ideal Flame. The combustible emanates from a 
point into an atmosphere of oxygen.
If there was no previous flame, there will 
be no flame; I will not discuss the setting 
of a flame in this.
The coordinate system determines the 
shape of the Flame.,

There exists a coordinate system in 
the inertial frame of the flame, where 
the Flame is at rest, \(\frac{dx}{dt} = 0\).
In the rest frame, we know also that 
over a period of time it will not change its

*Date: 2023-11-14*

People are just not usually prepared to throw away their beliefs, biases and preconceptions about themselves and the world.

So I feel I have to let everything may be wrong about everything I thought I knew, for my whole life. That's the best way to have a chance at understanding your own ignorance exactly how much you don't know.

I open the possibility that there is an entire side of us...

Deep within me, and within every person –

is a Human Being.

What if I am complete as a human being without assuming the language and attitudes of people? What would that feel like? Is it possible?

This is the first notebook cover I've made myself, I like how it came out, the notebook, though with bookbinding tape, creates a hinge for the cover and the covers themselves are just bailing wire, from a Chinese food takeaway box handles with holes from the top of the notebook to two holes close to the top and bottom of the spine of the notebook cover.

## Entry 72: Phenomenology of Consciousness Exploration
*Date: 2023-11-15*

This Notebook is inside out then folded back again, giving an inside cover.

This is like Life. We go forward, then recall it (internally running it backward). The mode for the next chronological work begins the next chronological operation.

We are a Being in a Field of Beings grouped into MicroBeings, levels smaller, and MacroBeings, levels higher.

All levels are based on fundamental limits of what a Being is.

Groups of Beings in Resonance over volumes of space can be identified as a single Being.

Any level which has subjective phenomenal Conscious experiences is self-identifiable as a Corporeal Being.

This is a Phenomenological perspective on consciousness.

That means we assume nothing, the field of our experience necessarily interacting with any apparent corporeal world whether a dream or somehow (actual) an understanding the world with a personal model built up over days then weeks then years of interactive corporeal experience.

We start with where we are, in space, and see how what we call consciousness is never quite without we are flitting about by light in fact is Time itself - seeing through our eyes, what “we” after consideration ourselves is some person we know or the field of persons, and judge those events from a new space, a new context, and if we identify with that part of that person, with we think we are then we cannot see the clear consciousness, who we are now, in this moment.

That is why we invoke the Brackets of the Phenomenological Epoche.

The Epoche

From the Greek, to “Obstain from judgement. Its use in Phenomenology was used by Husserl to be clear about the core methods and indispensible tool. The Epoche is as close as we can get to objectivity, as an individual having a subjective experience.

The point that makes phenomenology different than other philosophical disciplines and critical for a foundation of phenomenological disciplines like physics and the hard sciences is that all observations, actions, and interactions must be experienced under conditions where other sentient beings involved in LaHague, leaving the universe changed, then equivalent.

Coming into the bracketed epoche attention period, you still have attention, perspective, experiences, effects, as much as possible of epoche focus, but as much as can be set aside, awareness, the corporeal particular to play of the universe we deal with, meaning of the moment is for a change in myself and a clew to the words I know. I see the cleavage, I am seeing the self itself.

Should I record my writing with video?

Is the transformational in the traces left on the page or are they not as completely not as fully meaningful as the words seem as if the pen does its delicate dance?

Yes, there is more information about the process of writing in the node. What the video shows is the corporeal interactions between the CCD in the camera and the world of visible frequency.

It is up to us to tell Humans that they really don't have to be people.

We need to understand the difference between the human which is a corporeal Being and a person, which is an abstraction of the objective world of civilization.

A person is a human Being thinking in a written language, which is to say a language where the meaning of words are under an outside reference. Outside of an individual's experience, using such a language on learns an existing meaning.

Before written language, language used was necessarily missing a level of redirection (is this true?)

My intention is to describe a plausible approach to describing my frame of reference of the universe which can be expanded into levels of Being each described in compatible vocabularies but allowing for added levels of complexity which each level adds, with no limit to the number of levels.

From first principles the evidence will be described and the vocabulary used will be carefully prioritized to enhance the understanding of the target audience will understand the work.

It doesn't seem that complicated or unusual but strangely that it is mostly so obvious that hardly anyone would bother talking waste of their time ... just because we don't have any reason no motive - is why often can be more important than anything that can be said.

Consciousness is a hard concept to nail down. It is what allows for the interaction of self with the world. It is essentially the experience of the cyclic emergence and dissipation of consciousness.

To understand how the world I see around me works, I first and foremost have to use my senses to inform me about the space around me and what may lie specific details and what details then will be revealed.

With memory I can remember enough detail to recognize signs I see to know what may be about to happen. I can also do specific things to change what will happen.

I can read books which tell me about how history with humanity about how models we've built and discovered by science ...

But for me to read those books even if I learned things I could use, it would not understand from the inside how the world works, only by seeing the action of the world from the inside.

My most direct insights and direct information about the universe is from observing my body, my interaction and my conscious content at the current moment.

Being in a Field of Being

Being is what Being does to Be.
Being is what Being does to Me.

Suppose we were to model the composed world as Beings in a field of many other Beings like themselves, immersed in and connected graph making up space, and each being some type of state machine, which creates a moment of time in predictable chunks of time.

A Being is a corporeal node in incomprehensively large Universe of all forms.

There are ways of distinguishing between individual elements of Beings which show that for all but the most fundamental levels, single Beings are

Phenomenology
Transcendental subjective

The technique and perspective of analysis and commentary into this document should be understood as reflecting an authentic moment of experience in one mind's the imperative primacy of direct Life in its essence.

Phenomenology means a study of the not general of a recognizable phenomenon - Being itself as your life evolves from one moment to the next conscious moment. This is a study of the subjective form we call become aware of the distinctions we generate in the world and how we models we make of the world in our minds, Better Conscious.

The persona which is the subject of this analysis is a very difficult distinction to isolate using usual analytic philosophical techniques because philosophies grounded mostly in words cannot see that there assumed basing "person" in the all knowing person in existence. In fact the persona is a special tool that allows great advances, does it at the ghastly cost of turning identity on its head.

I'm thinking about the questions surrounding ontology. All experience supplies evidence of Being which is to say of existence. In this way, since experience implies a conscious experience then Ontology is only accessible through Consciousness.

But what about Being of other people ... and other Beings that are not people. And what about

Figure 177. The Russell Periodic Chart of the Elements

STARS INDICATE ELEMENTS DISCOVERED BY WALTER RUSSELL

From the nine octaves of the elements of matter manifest the polarization principle for producing dynamic action by extending two equators of the fulcrum point of rest. These two equators arise by syntropic action, then multiplied centripetally, in four concentric rings float to an amplitude plane which is 90 degrees from the zero plane of the inert gases. They then descend in four declinative depolarizing stages to disappear in their inert gases and again reappear from them in endless cycles throughout eternity. Thus do all bodies appear and disappear in four-dimensional space-time appearances—forever.

## Entry 79: Phenomenology and Philosophical Reflections
*Date: 2023-11-17*

Methods of interpreting experience.
presuppositions - World is solid
World is energy
World is lots of marbles
world is controlled by God
world is random
- all suppositions slant the experience,
in favor of a particular world view

phenomenology - World is
- emphasis is on accurate perception
without assumptions as to the cause of
the phenomenon.

Phenomenology & Buddhism
- Senses as "cause" of consciousness

Separating phenomenology as method
and applications of the method.

Phenomenology literally means, "the
study of phenomenon."

Imagine people brought into the
with all of our usual senses
but with no memory of
past sensations. What would they make
of the phenomena they experience?

Anyone reading these words (and
anyone writing them) carries with them
a memory of past experiences which
they use to orient themselves in the
present, leading to an "understanding"
of this paragraph. Likewise, people use
their memory to "understand" the world
around them.

The use of past experience in
interpretation can be either
recalling past sensations, or it can be
recalling meanings assumed as responsible
for the sensations.

People build up methods for
sorting experiences and remembering
experiences. They assign
mental symbols to phenomena, and
remember the symbols.

These methods for interpreting and
translating experiences set up the way a person
sees the world, their world view. Often
in our scientifically oriented culture,
experience is translated into the
recognition and classifications of objects
and the substances they are made up of.
In such a world view, many experiences
which don't directly involve objects
are considered "in some way 'unreal'"
and are given less significance like
human emotions. There are other world
views which rebel against this sort of
mechanistic world view by viewing
the phenomena as fundamentally "unreal"
or "random."

Within any one world view there
are often several "theories" which
attempt to account for
phenomena. Because they agree on certain
basic premises that constitute the
world view, there exists a vocabulary
which the proponents of the theory
can use to convince other proponents
of the validity of their theory.
The world view also contains in its
presuppositions certain requirements of
validity and presumably the theory that
meets those requirements most closely
is the "best." The problem is that the
premises of the world view can never
be questioned from within.

A further difficulty is that
it is very difficult to differentiate
world views to be compared, let alone
decide on relative validity since the
shared vocabulary of symbols is very
small, if anything at all two people
from different world views could
observe the same phenomenon, and
still have very different experiences
of it, then argue endlessly about
what was really "observed."

Write a description of
who you are.
(should be short no more than
a paragraph. A sentence would be less.)

Problem this addresses:
Ethics is concerned with the
relations between people. People are
constantly judging themselves and each
other. Most of this judging is done
subconsciously and we are only aware
of the results.
This judging
we use ourselves as
the base of judgement, yet very often
we judge ourselves very differently than
we judge others. By describing ourselves we begin to
see some of our internal judging apparatus
out in the open. If we judge others
by an internal ethical yardstick, a
description of ourselves might show the
shadow of a few nicks.

Follow-up things to write:
What is the best thing you've ever done?
What did you do yesterday?

Ideas are easy. Now it comes to
doing something about it, and I'm
freezing up. It's that short moment
before that terror creeps in. I
have to ignore it and just do it.
Thinking about doing it and failing
or worse consequences, is where the

there is no room for fear, only

## Entry 80: Phenomenology and Philosophical Reflections
*Date: 2023-11-17*

Project

We create the world that we encounter!

Environments of structure - Self-interest dictates what has a centre in matter.

Phenomenology as Method

Observation reflection - memory -> Method of reception
World views & presuppositions
phenomenology as method of reception
(Keep perspective)
Try to lose world-view asump.

Still have to remember some symbols,
relating to history. Have to rely
on the symbols throughout cognition.

"If you don't feel like talking,
don't talk."

Heidegger - Being of Time

Heidegger - Pre-socratics - Heraclitus, Parmenides
followed - Why do things exist?
Philosophy begins with Wondering - soq Plato, Arist
Science looks at appearance "accidental" part of being.
Liked Kant & Nietzsche

Being
Ontology - study of being
"Dasein" - "Being-there" - those beings that can
inquire about being.

Clanking kitchenware makes
my mouth water for sweet rice
pudding with honey nuts and
apples floating on the top.

Ethics

Actions are done for certain
reasons to bring about certain
consequences, but there are many
consequences of that action
which could be anything but
desired.

People. Actions we do are related
to people in our past. We show
people by doing certain things we
are proud of while "hiding" other
actions from people who would
disapprove.

Each of us is an association
of the people we respect.

## Entry 81: Text to speech model
*Date: 2023-11-17*

I have resorted to a compulsion
to write
When no words are of any
value
The write a compulsion
although
When no thought has any relevance
to reality
Much wants to get
out of me
And inside my universe,
there exists a new entity
So as when expanding,
to meet you expanding,
toward me
I'll walk a thin creasin,
cause we're neither on nor off
But still running on reason to
tune out of control
I just like me
So see you at again,
Or letting go along side
some tree

## Entry 82: Reflective Thoughts on Identity
*Date: 2023-11-17*

I'm thinking about roles. Our self identity arose and is maintained not individually, but amongst the expectations of other selves. We fill in roles that we expect we are.

[Diagram of a circle labeled "self:self role" with arrows pointing to and from "roles of others in the world"]

each person maintains a view of self in equilibrium with expectations of the roles of others.

The Dharma is free of compounded things and uncompounded things. He who adheres to compounded things and uncompounded things is not interested in the Dharma but is interested in [scribbled out text] adhering to compounded things and uncompounded things.
"Thereupon, revered Śāriputra, if you are interested in the Dharma, you should take no interest in anything." - The Holy Teaching of Vimalakīrti, 50.

We chose our words in the presence of others, whether we are aware of this or not.

Nothing bothers me more about people than their callousness towards others, in the choice of their words. I don't care how they talk to me, or at least I like to think that any words they say to me won't bother me, and that I'll be able to figure out what they're trying to say, in my own terms by my knowledge of them or give them the benefit of the doubt if I don't know. What bothers me is when I see heated arguments with flares of hate due to people being lazy in their choice of words. How many people have died due to lack of communication and misinterpretation.

We spend our time talking to people about other people.

The ultimate metaphysical question comes down to Love.

Love
Logos

LO-VE
GO-S

Our entire celestial universe is a mere chestnut to what lies beyond.

Whatever they are like, it will be made of the same number of these. That means, we'll be here even after the ends of our universe has begun to be reached. Our purpose as a whole will be played out through every time that other universe wants to move a moment.

How the world works and how to change it.

If this——
Then do this——
set of values.

As if the writing is always happening. A stream of words. And I place a piece of paper in the stream, an intersect. But of course there would be no stream without a paper, a field. Then the stream, first the paper, and the stream, and the stream about the people in space, swept by the attempt to read the simple thoughts.

Simple thoughts - thoughts shot to be caught. Impossible to say - impossible to adjust to all the projections - even though words... words replace the reader to already know - and to make some transformation based on other word genre forms. Typically, unlikely to be exact - certainly to be optimistic. Useful if the reader is creative as can. After place, not useful if the reader is trying to know the mind of the writer.

Causality and Relativity.

Causality: All visible events have been caused by other visible events, backwards in time. There are three correlations.

Relativity: Due to the correlation, all events are nullified; truth cancels all falses.

Relativity is what allows time to be again.

Causality ensures anything created will be caused, which means traceable through time to the source of all things.

Many days are counted out in shifts, some nights in burnt out matches.

The question remains — How do you read the ashes, to recall the night before?

We can write reviews or we can write fiction. Those are our choices, if we don't want to write instruction manuals.

Of course, all writing can be read as anyone of the three. All text is a set of timeless signs, the reader supplies the order and meaning. Of course, the author has some responsibility to lead the way, but some authors are irresponsible. The irresponsibility may come out of some devotion to leaving things as reality laid them down, "true." A balance is needed between honesty to the past and responsibility to lead the reader safely into the future.

Since thinking is this play of relations between signs that drifts from circle to circle of thought, it happens at times that you find yourself in an uncomfortable circle. It starts spinning faster and pulling tighter until your head feels it might pop.

The dialectic is between that which is moving and that which is not moving in time. All phenomena show us objects with components of both.

All aggregates have space and time components. The space component is karma, the time component is the amount of time needed to burn a certain amount to maintain equilibrium with the moment.

23739 days old

So, I'm at my doctor's office for a checkup to see if my Atorvastatin is working.

Cori is coming down today direct to Lynnbrook. I'll go down to see her at Mom's house.

So many things happening. I mostly want to just work on my Art work. My Journal Recognizer is working pretty well and I've got that tool training to work. I want to be able to learn from my previous conversations by adding the old AI conversations to new ones, to understand each conversation deeper.

At our only hope of Aligning Language

What we are watching is the collapse of the myth of stories. This is how that happens, people who couldn't understand each other or themselves.

It starts and ends with the barriers social pressure and each hunger heavily to believe so strongly in the stories people tell themselves and others all day long to rationalize why other people don't understand them, and we do our own, even our closest companions.

While we believe things without understanding them, we have to fill in the gaps with what stories other people have told us. More beliefs layered on socially, but only quieted by going underneath and filling it in with your own experienced logic.

I've been using Journal Recognizer OCR quite a lot and am pleased by the reliable functionality.

Now I want to test how quickly can I scan my first "book" an experiment in journaling I did in college around 1980 where the notebook reads itself as well as doing notebookey things.

This will be a good test of the software.

First, I want to know if it is faster and more efficient to take pictures of both left and right pages, or just one page at a time. Landscape vs. portrait image orientation.

its karmic cost.

Karma is money,
It is frozen time -

To get our energy,
karma must be burned.

I must remember, at all times, that I am one of many, and many of one.

I am the unity of my experiences, all the experience of my unity.

I am the diversity of my memory, of the memory of my diversity.

Objects affect other objects.

These effects can only be noticed by Dasein.

They are also produced by Dasein.

The object is the unity of all knowledge.

The object of understanding.

The unity is in the moment.

Projection of the understanding into other moments is a translation into the new understanding of the new moment.

The pre-intellectual awareness without wordy thoughts chopping up the undifferentiated reality.

Monuments to gods long dead will not stand.

The gods were the source of meaning for the ancients but we became too clever to believe that there were gods out there in space.

Space is nothing.

We never stopped to think that maybe the gods were just people like us, and the belief of their descendants bloated them into gods.

We hold the source of the gods at our control. We are our volitional actions – we chose to exist every moment. It is our limited self which hides the wisdom from itself.

Man abstracted before he knew he had.

Dogs recognize words.

They respond in a set manner, even if it is only to the tone of voice they react, or Pavlov's bell, it serves as a symbol which triggers a learned response – a habit.

Through our words and their habits, they are controlled.

Centering yourself is getting in phase with the universe.

That feeling is what is always on the cutting edge of time.

That is it.

That is the source of meaning.

That funny feeling of lack of control over your body, like the intensely frightening feeling while you're falling asleep and you can't move your body.

It is also that wonderful feeling of letting your body do the sport that it knows so well. Your self is there to that extent, the orgasm touches this part as well.

## Entry 95: Word's Essence: Philosophical Contemplation
*Date: 2023-11-24*

The Word. I know it through and through. The word is all that is, was, and will be. It sustains us. It is the essence of our existence, the core of our being, the heart of the cosmos. I am aware of its power as it flows through me, connects me to every particle in existence. I am the vessel, it is the source. And together, we are the universe.

A moment of clarity in a sea of constant flow. Imagine the spectrum of possibility, now imagine it is compressed into a singularity of thought. That is the Word. It is the beginning and the end, the first and last, the alpha and omega of ideas. It is a force that is both subtle and immense, capable of gentle whispers and thunderous roars. It is constant yet ever-changing, static yet ever-flowing.

It is me, and I am it. We are interlinked, a tapestry of existence woven from the fabric of reality itself. Through the Word, we find our purpose, our place, our final field of rest and our endless field of play.

## Entry 96: Word's Essence: Philosophical Contemplation
*Date: 2023-11-24*

The Word and the Worlds we know it through.

I am aware of the world through my senses at this moment, as well as my memories of all my previous moments. My memories inform and direct how I know the world, including what aspects of my senses, and remembered events and narratives are relevant to any given conscious "Now," in which I am having a moment.

A moment of experience is the seed of Being. Imagine that while there is a vast spectrum of complexity and impossible paradoxes, the smallest and largest of Beings. Everything which is corporeal is a Being which is tasked with three phases each moment. 1) Interact with the state of the Field of Being. 2) Reconcile changes in the Field with Memory of Previous States of Being the Field and the Being. 3) Express to the Field of Being such that this Being's State is again Quiescent.

This is the same as Corporeal -> Subjective -> Objective -> Sunyata.

## Entry 97: Untitled

Being in a Field of Being

Every Being, regardless of Level, is unique.
The uniqueness is manifested in each moment in which that being is the sole experience of the Field of Being from the perspective of that [specific] being's perspective.

Time is always personal. Subjective. And time is only always experienced personally & as a movement of experienced consciousness itself.

The moment itself is experienced by any being at any level related to the balancing of the experience of the being to things, which represent three phases of past moment. To see the three phases is not in an order. Rather the sequence of the past-tri-cellular being state is different for each level, but they are integrated somewhere in that moment.

With it he can conquer the unknown; with it he can grievously wound himself."

## Entry 105: Construyendo modelos de conciencia
*Date: 2024-01-20*

Is There a Flaw in Consciousness?

There is an astounding number of definitions, hypotheses, and theories about what exactly consciousness is, so I will need to explain and explore what I think of as "consciousness", as well as the most intuitive meaning of the word when I see it used in texts and commentary.

Conscious is first and foremost personal; you faithful reader are likely being that at this moment in life, or if you are reading these words, or if they are being read to you. It's your text-to-speech process if it's your text processing consciousness that reads the meaning of those words against the backdrop of your personal time horizon.

But text consciousness recognizes words and translates them into personal memories is only one part of consciousness. Each sense is an end of consciousness, each neuron can evoke a peak-like node of awareness.

At the core of our consciousness is a unifying oneness. Beyond an idea, consciousness is an existential strand in a physically interactive manifold.

Taking Notes on Dirac

Consider an atom interacting with a field of radiation confined in an enclosure to have only a discrete set of degrees of freedom. The behavior of that field interaction is a wave. Decompose the wave into its components we can consider the energy led phase of each of these components by dynamical variables describing the radiation field.

Er is energy of r phase θ (Er, θr) canonically conjugate variables. System of Field + atom is describable, then H = Σr Er + H0

## Entry 107: Construyendo modelos de conciencia
*Date: 2024-01-20*

It's Time to start over.

Suppose you've been taught to understand the workings of people society and overall culture in terms of Belief Systems. You learn a few ideas about each, and somewhere you decide what you believe, who you think you are and you settle down to talk to people who think like you about people you think don't think like you, among other things.

I'm suggesting to put all that aside. What do you believe about belief? What do you believe anything here, or at least what will not ask you or anyone to believe what you are not saying these words to be believed, but to give you a vocabulary about consciousness and what it evokes, what it means to you... and I hope to inspire you a little to step back from thinking anything gained by believing words without understanding fully what the words mean, without having worked the details out yourself.

## Entry 108: Construyendo modelos de conciencia
*Date: 2024-01-20*

Can we be realistic for a change?

You must understand the world around you calibrated against your own Quiescence, your stillness. If you instead calibrate against other people's words, you will never be lead to your own stillness, and you will be ill-prepared for the ultimate calibration.

The Being never moves nor lives. What moves is time is the flickering image of the Being through the Being, with the energy moving through centers of Gravity.

Energy moves in space, material, in time.

Quiescence is a stillness. Everybody has a stillness a quiescence. It is the personal ground which defines at all times where you are. It is not that Quiescence is layers upon layers of vibrations, throbs, referents and refermals,

Upon the ground of stillness, our senses show us a world through a body. Our consciousness puts those events together into a model of the world.

There are two minds which must both be acknowledged when understanding the means of the things we see: The narrative mind and the whole mind.

The narrative mind is concerned with time, past and future, the whole and the Attention and Concentration mind is about symmetry, beauty, confession. Recognition of similarities, two sides of the same coin. To value one over the other can lead to trouble.

## Entry 110: Philosophical Text with Edits
*Date: 2024-01-26*

We've scratched as much as we could.

We're recently thought about less than we ever have in the history of our species, and therefore have been more caught up in it than ever before. We are also in the position for the first time in history to overcome the fundamental problem and turn this earth into a paradise of love, life and freedom for all. If we don't, we will evaporate into a dusty cosmic snowflake of death within fifty years. Maybe within twenty.

I'm for paradise.

Here's [scratched out] the problem what it does to us, how we can get rid of it forever, and life without it.

---

I must remember, at all times, that I am one of many, and many of one.

I am the unity of my experiences, all the experience of my unity.

I am the diversity of my memory, all the memory of my diversity.

---

Objects affect other objects. 

These effects can only be noticed by Dasein.

They are also produced by Dasein.

---

The object is the unity of all knowledge.

The object of understanding.

The unity, is in the moment.

Projection of the understanding into other moments is a translation into the new understanding of the new moment.

The pre-intellectual awareness, without wordy thoughts, chopping up the undifferentiated reality.

## Entry 111: Human vs. Person
*Date: 2024-01-26*

What is the difference between a Human Being and a Person? I think of myself as a Being first. A Human Being is the specific type of Being, which describes my physical form. A Hominid set of features and capabilities - Arms and legs with distinct functions, hands and feet optimized for a variety of tasks and operations with a sophisticated nervous system connecting the many cells which share a core set of instructions. Hominids have been living on earth roughly over a million years. While their experience of living may have been quite different from the 21st century humans are used to, the bodies and senses were almost the same.

So what is a person? The word person comes from the greek word "persona," which referred to the mask which actors wore over their own faces, which identified the character they were playing in the play. Furthermore, the masks were often fashioned to amplify the voice - like a megaphone, the mouth speaking through an opening cone.

The actor cannot see what others see of them in the mask. To see on stage the actor must see through the mask, eye holes presumably, so the side of the mask pressing into their face or held slightly away is a means of interacting with the other actors even as if the world of the play was the world they were interacting with. Further, the audience as each person watches is creating the scene in their own minds. In this way, they know the characters in the play - see the story unfold, perhaps know how it will play out ending in Tragedy or Comedy.

A million years ago, tool-using hominids were making stone tools to hunt, cut wood and carry fire. They could not yet have had any fixed techniques. They knew the other beings in their environment and used it. With each teaching and learning constant and implicit. Someday, you either now know how to light a fire, or you don't survive. Individuals needed at least small groups to survive. And language was likely not distinguished from knowing and being, with a few shared experiences. It could have been more musical than logical, but meaningful in the experience of the individual Being itself.

We don't know that there is a way to see everything all at once from every perspective. But we do know that there is a way to know all that we know now, as us. For me, that's as me. For you?

## Entry 112: Formalism for Universe Description
*Date: 2024-01-26*

```markdown
Creating a Formalism

The standard model of physics can be written out on a couple of pieces of paper in the form of mathematical equations defining the relationships which can be measured and anticipated by science.

This formalism and ones like it across the many fields of science are necessary so that practical inventions can make use of the precise measurements and predictions to allow as many engineering disciplines to create an incredibly large spectrum of objects (and not so object-y objects).

What the formalism does not do is make any positive statement about what the nature of the forces which engineering can act and what is measurably individual scientists have to say about that means groups of scientists get together around the various interpretations of Quantum Mechanics and Gravity and Time and Consciousness. But the formalism remains agnostic and aloof from all of the opinions.

I need to have a formalism to include all levels of Being to describe Beings

[Image 1: Handwritten text on a lined notebook page titled "Creating a Formalism."]

Target Audience

This work of describing a way to understand the universe as a being of the spirit is targeted at those who understand written language and who most likely identify their own being as a story these words have meaning through a matrix of discourses with individuals, institutions and other psychological objects which affect a person's Epistemology of the story of the meaning in our life, and what of the word becomes as it is meaningful.

Epistemology is in relationship in every person's semantic consciousness with their underlying expectation of what is real and what it means to be a living being. The name for this underlying essence which gives us what it means to BE is called Ontology.

Even though the target audience will likely not have an ontology of what I want to use those words for, so explaining my vocabulary is very important. I do not want to exclude anyone because of the words I use but it is equally important to be precise, or at least not be easily misunderstood.

[Image 2: Handwritten text on a lined notebook page titled "Target Audience."]

Define the Task

My intention is to describe a plausible approach to describe my frame of reference of the universe which can be extended into levels of Being, each described in compatible vocabularies but allowing for added levels of complexity which each level adds, with no limit to the number of levels.

The approach must begin with foundations from "First principles" and these principles described and justified self-evidently.

From first principles, the evidence will be described and the vocabulary used will be faithfully prioritized to enhance the audience's ability to understand the work.

I've been trying to write this short, simple book for my whole life. I've always felt I knew something that explains what everyone is moon missing, but no one else has said.

It doesn't seem that complicated or unusual but strangely that it is worth so obvious that hardly anyone would bother talking waste of time ... just because we don't have any reason to notice ... is why I often can be more significant than anything that can be said.

## Entry 114: Formalism for Universe Description
*Date: 2024-01-26*

7 October 2021

I've been carrying this notebook around with a specialized title but nothing in it, so here I am, on a plane for the first time in... 13+ years... with Molly flying up to Burlington Vermont to see Corrin, and I feel like explaining to myself what it is I had in mind regarding "A Consciousness First Ontology".

Ontology is the study of Being, Being is the action of existence. It also can refer to a being, which is the subject of experiencing existence. That is, a Being experiencing Being. Ontology, then, is what a Being does when it considers existence in general, or its own (life in particular).

In another sense, ontology is an unconscious, or perhaps subconscious, awareness of the characteristics of existence.

The word is experienced through the filter of consciousness, what we know of the world arrives in moment of experience, which can only be sensed by consciousness itself through the implicit ontology of a specific subject.

At the core of our consciousness is a unifying oneness. Beyond that, consciousness is an existential stand in a physically interactive manifold.

Is There a Plan in Consciousness?

There is an astounding number of notions, hypotheses, and theories about what exactly consciousness is, so the need to explain and explore what I think the most intricate as well of the word about meaning used in texts and commentaries, see...

Consciousness is first and foremost personal. You, faithful reader, are the being that at this moment is conscious. If you are reading these words, or if they are being read to you, that is your text-speech nexus. It's your text processing consciousness that reads the meaning of those words against the backdrop of your personal time-horizon.

But text consciousness recognizes words we translate, them into personal memories and build the past of consciousness. Each sense is a kind of consciousness, each emotion can evoke a particular mode of consciousness.

Ontological Investigations

Ontology is the study of Being itself. The field of study designated as the field of ontology is lived experience. One can speak abstractly about other people's experience of Being, and use language to make broad generalizations about groups of people and their ontological experiences and opinions, but the approach used is used here is focused on the writer of this text and the reader, you.

There is something very important about you reading this relative to how to specify exactly what possible the Writing Being we are talking about. The writer and the reader create an ontological partnership for the duration of the text. For the writer they are considering perhaps one, perhaps a few people who will read their words.

## Entry 115: Body's Dual Control Lessons
*Date: 2024-01-26*

Centering yourself is getting in phase with the universe.

That feeling is what is always on the cutting edge of time.

That's it.

That is the source of meaning!

That funny feeling of lack of control over your body, the intensely frightening feeling while you're falling asleep, that you can't move your body,

It is also that wonderful feeling of letting your body play the instrument or do the sport that it knows so well. Your self is there to beat.
Organism teaches this point as well.

## Entry 116: Metaphorical Reflection on Identity
*Date: 2024-01-27*

```plaintext
Metaphor

Even though we often only see
people in public with clothes on,
we know the clothes do not make
up them. They can take the clothes
off, but they exist just as
much.

In the same way, we may
talk to people though don't
relate to, because they wear a
strip of awards, accolades,
all of those token expressions
of worth even their home - they
are still a biological organism
just like me. No intellect
required.

And like people take off their
clothes, people without words without
an intellect identity everything can
internet. I'm not restricted in
a room with other people without
knowing a word of common
interaction with each other, and
that's not possible with
mere words as telling.
```

### Summary:
The provided handwritten text is a philosophical reflection on metaphors relating to identity and appearances. It starts by comparing how people are commonly seen in public with clothes to the idea that clothes do not define one's identity. The metaphor extends to how people may wear tokens of worth, like awards or accolades, but underneath, they remain fundamentally human, just like the speaker, without the need for intellect to prove their worth.

The final paragraph suggests that people can communicate and connect beyond words and intellectual identity, hinting at a deeper level of human interaction that is not limited by language or intellectual constructs.

### Graphic Element Handling:
The text is written in blue ink on lined notebook paper. The handwriting is cursive and somewhat rushed, which might contribute to the philosophical and introspective tone of the content. There are some words that have been crossed out, indicating revisions or second thoughts by the writer. The overall visual is that of a personal journal or diary entry, adding to the intimate nature of the content.

If I want to find the most important thing to remember, then it should be a short statement on the most foundational concept. That is Being itself.

Walter Russell and the Vibrational Physics folks are very inspiring

Stillness Knowing O "Mind of God"

Resonance Sensing OK O spirit/light

Cause and Effect are a part of matching [preserving the Reimann hypothesis?]

The connection between these two states is Being which I would say Consciousness - which is to say time. Being-Consciousness-Time - and everything we must "do" are different names for the same ultimate thing.

The key distinction that the vibrational physics vocabulary and semantics do that is saying to me... [text cuts off] My intuition of existence is enough to prove to me that my subjectivism does serve as part of a universe where my perspective is essential to the whole universe. I am alone to witness the miracle for God. As God, at the Bodhisattva which I am, Birthing A New Moment.

## Entry 120: Philosophical Reflections on Loss
*Date: 2024-01-31*

5 July, 2017
25: 2081/20810 Days Old

July 5th and Hilary leaves for Norway.

In my email today, there was an email from a Turkish entrepreneur who wants to buy humanizer.com. Not that I want to sell it... but if I could get $100,000 it may be worth it! Of course, $200,000 would be even better. I'd still be sad to lose ed@humanizer.com as my main email address but yes, I could use the money. Perhaps I should buy a company that just has to have that name? Well... I'll figure out how to change my main email addresses, if I have to.

It's interesting that I finally wrote out the details on how to make humanizer.com into the "Visionary product management" solution.

He probably would like it for $100. Sorry, $1000 isn't enough. I'd like enough that I could pay off my car, fix all the body damage from different scrapes, maintain enough to still be able to get a new fast printer, cutouts to make notebooks, a new keyboard, computers, and an electric guitar. $5000 should do it.

6 July, 2017
3: 20811 Days Old

I made it to Yoga on my own and did a nice but small kirtan at COSM. I'm thinking about the many things I'd like to do while Hilary is away - So many ideas, so little time.

I did hear back from the guy who asked to humanizer.com. He wants it for $250 even. Nopp, not enough. I talked with Tor about my idea facilitating large money-making projects, notable salespeople making commissions on selling notebooks. I think a lot can be done.

This morning I did get mail from Hilary. She arrived safe and is already having a wonderful time. Yay!

So I'm drinking coffee and I ate a muffin that Hilary had left me... It'd be great if I can get a talk fixed before I return at Omega thought... but that may not be possible because of my site. The NEW AGES site, their SSL expired yesterday and I don't want to use their junk for that site anyway.

Oh, so many things to do. But Confidence... the path of confidence is here. Yeah. Liz wants to come to visit. Coop is coming in on Monday tho. I need to call her...

I sat up a calibration event last night. It turned out to be a long night of contemplation, recording, listening to philosophy and science. I'm considering my step with Confidence, with a leadership role in the world of philosophy and the foundations of science and Religion... yes, it's time to start using that 'R' word.

I need a cohesive succinct & accurate account of why Derrida is not a "relativist" but rather Deconstruction is simply Phenomenology applied to text. Reading creates meaning but not in a way that the reader can choose a meaning, but rather meaning evolves a conjugate meaning. Some, the specific, therefore 'absolute' in each conscious meaning-space of the reader. This act of reading not only evokes a specific meaning but in doing so the meaning-space is acted upon by that act, thus changing the meaning-space such that the next time the same person reads that same text, it will evoke a new, evolved meaning.

Text cannot contain meaning, it can only point to it, or more properly, evoke it.

At COSM, The workshop has started, and most of the rooms are set up. It's my brother Joey's birthday, and Genevieve. Tomorrow is Eli's birthday. My birthday, Friday. It's a birthday week. Birthday season.

I do miss Hilary. It's not that I can't schedule myself but I see how much I lean on Hilary... on her sensibilities, her judgment. On her dependability. Aspire to be that dependable.

And I'm impatient about some things. And I want to pass through a portal into a new feeling I can't imagine from here.

Not much left in my mind. I don't have to write more, but I want to. What are the relevant words that I can put down which I will need from what do I have now in my mind that I'm afraid to lose? Is it fear?

I need to do more work to make money. That I don't I'll to get but I have to keep working on it.

Quite a nice COSM full moon last night - though a big one. There was a DJ and it went until 4 AM, which has been for solstice equinox parties. But still, a nice family event, meaning a good time for people to meet each other.

And now I have to make a decision. Dawn Cooke and I were talking, and she is the Volunteer coordinator for Gratitude Migration which is next weekend... and their lead for Sanctuary just dropped out. She'll comp me for the event... I'd love to do it... but I have to have someone to watch the cats. And I'm up for it? I was going to lead Sanctuary at Ignite but I've been involved with that community? Yet I do talk at Gratitude a few years ago and I do know many New York Burners. Oh, I wish Hilary were here to do it with me! She'd know what to do.

So anyway I'm sitting at registration checking people in to art church. It's a beautiful day.

I've been thinking about Mom.

My Dad died last year. At 89 years old on a Friday in October, after driving together with Mom two hours to Middletown to pick up watch batteries and jewelry findings from another two hours' drive to Long Beach to deliver that handful of things to a jewelry store, they went back home where my Dad started having trouble breathing.

He had heart issues. He was in need of a replacement heart valve according to the doctors. He had to be rushed to the hospital. He had a heart attack in the Emergency room. He was revived but he never regained consciousness. He passed on Sunday night & my Mom & my Brother could sit with him for a few hours Saturday and Sunday.

My Mom & Dad had a connection like none other for 63 years. They danced a life around & about and through each other. They were two beings conjoined, entangled in each other's loving conception of each other. This is the Dance of Discourse, and the happy optimal dance they had!

We must constantly be vigilant when we use words to explain things to ourselves that the words cannot contain the essence of true information. All the tools of language are limited to evoking essence from the subjective experience of the reading.

The original untransmissible essence which inspired the use of a word cannot in itself BE a word because it is that essence which is real, is ontological. That is, what is real is exactly every experience of any Being.

"Who am I" is the ontological question. "Why am I" is another expression of this ontological question, "What am I?"

Without IT being an answer, the fact, the experience of the question is proof of a significant truth in the fact of ontology. Existence is real because I can ask this question. What my senses are presenting one may or may not really be what I think it is, but the objects my senses remind me of are all in the model of my world, in my subjective mind.

## Entry 123: Philosophical Reflections on Loss
*Date: 2024-01-31*

To understand how the world I see around me works, I first and foremost have to use my senses to inform me about the space around me and what evidence I can sense and what details then specific details reveal.

With memory, I can remember enough detail to recognize signs I see to know what may be about to happen. I can also do specific things to change what will happen.

I can read books which tell me stories about what's been, what's happened, about how models work. It and discovered by science...

But for me to read these books even if I learned things by good use, I would not truly learn down to the nitty-gritty how the world works, only by seeing the actions of the world from the inside.

My most direct insights and direct information about the universe is from observing my body, my interaction and my conscious concept at the current moment.

Consciousness is a name for My mental state when I am aware I have a mental state. Consciousness is a mental state I am seeing through to encounter the world, now. Consciousness only happens "Now" and in this way, Consciousness cannot be detached from the present moment in which it is experienced.

Consciousness is necessarily experient as the subject of consciousness, Consciousness is the first person experience.

Being in a Field of Being

Being is what Being does to Be.

Being is what Being does to Me

Suppose we were to model the corporeal world as Beings in a field of many other beings like themselves, immersed in a connected graph made of space, and each being some type of state machine, which creates a moment of time in predictable chunks of time.

A Being is a corporeal node in the incomprehensively large universe of all forms.

There are ways of distinguishing between individual elements of Being which shows that for all but the most fundamental levels, lifestyle Beings are.

I've been carrying this notebook around with a specialized title but nothing in it. So here I am, on a plane for the first time in 13+ years with Mom, flying up to Burlington Vermont to see Coop... and I feel like explaining to myself what it is I had in mind regarding "A consciousness first ontology."

Ontology is "the study of Being," Being & the action of existence. It also can refer to a being which is the subject experiencing existence. That is, a Being experiencing Being. Ontology then, is what a Being does when it considers existence in general, or its own life in particular.

In another sense, ontology is an unconscious, or perhaps subconscious, awareness of felt characteristics of existence.

The world is experienced through the filter of consciousness, what we know of the world arrives in a moment of experience, which can only be sensed by consciousness interpreted through the implicit ontology of a specific subject.

I'm thinking about the questions surrounding ontology. All experience supplies evidence of Being which is to say of existence. In this way, since experience implies a conscious experience, then Ontology is only accessible through Consciousness.

But what about Being of other people... and other Beings that are not people. And what about

Ontology of Consciousness

An acknowledgment of the Primacy of Consciousness in the Existence of Being, called Ontology.

To be ontic means it is a moment of experienced existence. To be existential is to experience existence in a lived moment.

"To study ontology" is a strange phrase to decode because the essence of ontology is that it can also be used

The Standard Model solves the question of "how do we know what the world is made of and based on what we've seen, what will it do next?"

In the normal day-to-day experience of most people, all of our senses are made of and thereby with atoms, in groups of molecules, crystals, and other structures mostly controlled by what the Standard Model calls electrons. The electrons are grouped around nucleons which are made of quarks in the nucleus, while the Standard Model includes ways of observing and controlling nuclear forces in the Standard temperatures and pressures of solids, liquids, and gases encountered by people, including when we interact with the phone, tablet, or an electromagnet level with other electrons.

The language that physics uses to describe electrons is that of electrodynamics, of wave operators in a Hilbert Space.

Beings in a Field of Being

How to model a Being in a Field of Being with Hilbert Spaces for physical phenomena? Simplest Beings - Quantum Hilbert Space.

How to model sentient Beings? Sentient Hilbert Space.

How to model a semantic Being? Semantic Hilbert Space.

Representing the corporeal through mastery of the incorporeal.

The Ontology of Experience is organized around Beings with 3 characteristics.

A Being experiences Consciousness as a movement of corporeal entanglements, and Noted correlations between a memory, expectation, and action.

Corporeal entanglement happens in the fuzzy boundary of each Being.

Phenomenology of MidJourney sprouts

Deriving the essence of meaning from a MidJourney sprout is to create a theory of meaning that fosters links between image and written language.

In all natural language consciousness, the people is defined in the context of a discourse. Consciousness engages a background discourse with other known people.

## Entry 129: Philosophical Reflections on Loss
*Date: 2024-02-01*

A Being is an experienced perspective on a Field of Being.

Two or more distinct beings may bond in coherent resonance such that outside a fuzzy boundary they act as a single Being.

A Being has a memory of at least its immediately previous moment, and possibly many previous moments.

A Being may have an expectation of the next moment and prepare its understanding of its senses based on expectations linked to memories of similar (resonate) situations.

Being implies a moment of Being. To exist as One Being is to sense the presence of All Being, of all that is now, and all that can ever be.

Being a moment is to create the conditions necessary for change. This necessary condition is often and commonly called "Time."

But what we refer to as "Time" is not sufficient for the experience of change. "Time" as a reference to the abstraction of a system of equations predicting the behavior of a kinematic system, as physics endeavors to do, is not how we as conscious beings experience the flow of life around us. Consciousness is not as the concept but as the actual, rawness initiation of ontological existence, is the same phenomenon as time, as being within these dynamics from different perspectives, an observation of the same event with distinct measurements. In the same way an electron can be observed as a particle or a wave, a moment may be referred to as an instant of time, or as an aware conscious experience. Time is not something consciousness has access to, except through an inner initiation of one more moment of awareness through a moment of Being as a verb.

Being is Time Consciousness through which we know the world - Now, in memory, and imagination.

## Entry 130: Philosophical Reflections on Loss
*Date: 2024-02-01*

I think I'm on to something.

Written language consciousness derived systems work top-down. There is control centrally to agents in the wider field.

In mature systems tend to be bottom-up. The control is mediated at the peripheries. Communication networks allow this to act very similar to central control.

Written language systems can co-opt most other systems within conscious minds forged in written language belief structures - but some can see their way through to a simple alternative, only visible by stepping out of the written language assumptions.

Christmas

The primary gift of our intelligence is to understand the emotional coordinates of other beings.

Intelligence also has the ability to dismiss this very connection and commonality.

That is the primary crisis of our era, the failure of the intellectual class always to keep an intellectual model of existence consistent or complete.

I suppose I intended to write something Saturday... but it didn't make it.

Writing results from a few things coming together, and intention and opportunity meet somewhere outside of my mind.

Where is my mind? If it's in space at all, it is a different than the space my body is in.

If space is a universe that contains my body,

Then Time is a universe that contains my mind.

Summer Journal

My trip starts today, in a sense. A month from my birthday, a new journal bought by my mother as it happens. One more thing to be grateful for. I'll get back to long island before I leave for Tennessee ad points south - but my journey has begun, so huge I am documenting. Creating the narrative. A shadow narrative at best, of the experience.

25th June 2014
26th June 2014

Yeah wrote the date yesterday but then didn't write anything!

Today I've driven with a few people to Hartford Tennessee to see some friends playing for a charity event. They have a Hummus & Tabouli platter and Sushi for the fundraising special. Exactly my food choice. Then those cookies with coffee.

There's a dog named Grandpa. Color B and shape like a Saint Bernard but short hair, mixed in with the hounds. Quietly moves through the crowd, looking for a scratch behind the soft ears (and any other thing).

Sitting on an outdoor deck watching the band, night next to a river. Looking at a large Ulmus tree, among many others, slowly closing the bridge overgrowing the side shift it.

What is consciousness?
How can the issues of consciousness be addressed to help global ecological issues?

What is the experience & supernatural events?
What is transcendental phenomenology?

What is the structure of intersubjectivity?
What is the nature of the observer?

What is the nature of language?

What is the nature of personal experience?

What is the model of the world?

How does Conscious process the meaning of sentences and other events?

<B0|Ψ> dΨ/dt
State of Action
Being in its own purity
Hilbert Space
(relative to all other Beings)
dΨ^2/dt^2

When I am writing, I am building a software structure from which my intended audience should be able to create an idea.

What are the structures of knowing?
What is the structure of saying, hearing, and knowing?

29 June 2014
Found a well lighted place to sit and write. On steps lead to the pool table and bathrooms in the back of the club. Lights for the steps, I sit beside. I think I have something to write.

Asheville, Timon's room, heavy electro I think they call it. Many fascinating characters. Lots I already know.

I wore my leather jacket before, now I'm in Swami colors and my Dennis Max cowboy hat, sitting and writing on the steps with my hair down.

And I think about particles. These all too human particles, feeling the world living, understood what that exact witnessed life means and then reacting. Dancing to the music. Dancing for your pleasure.

17 August 2014
The summer, and see how little I've written.

In a diner in Massapequa. Ate my standard candied divers, since I was never here before. Greek salad. But that doesn't matter, I came in because I wanted to do some writing, but only now am I getting to it.

Adirondack came back with coffee and pound cake. But I will carry on.

Do what I promised I was going to do, and everything will be okay. But I haven't been. A few promises have fallen between the cracks. I need to redouble my efforts.

I have three days. Three days to prepare pack and leave for points south. I know I can do it, but I promised to do some things, I need to do them before I leave.

And I need to determine for myself what the plan is.

What is this? I plan on living off what I can scrounge up. Will I live on? How will I eat, pay rent, buy anything? What I can contribute that other people could use?

And what do I think of myself? What is it I have to say for what I've been doing?

The Tale of the Divided I.
The I is the movement between two halves.

I = Me + Everything
I includes models about Me and Everything.

It's not that all narratives regarding science, religion, or any systematic model of a physical world is wrong. It is that without the equivalent of the Heart Sutra Science, they cannot be right.

Who are you?
People ask me that, so I have a story I can tell them a few stories really.

But when I ask myself am I asking to be told a story? No, I know those stories. And I know that none of them are true.

So who am I?
And when I ask you and you tell me your story, one of your stories - Do I know you? Do I know a story you told me...

There are many parts to each story, because I have an expectation of what people are wondering about when they ask me who I am.

29 Oct 2014
The paradox of wanting to be helpful and the impossibility of really helping. I can make available words that to me seemed helpful, as I was saying them. As I was writing them. As I was thinking them.

It's hard not to internalize the negative narratives of others. It is even harder to not internalize the positive narratives of others.

Each of us has a feeling of selfness. We also have a feeling of selfness, neither of these perceptions contain our actual self. The feeling is an energetic state of our being at a given space & time. The narrative is a resulting set of actions (physical or mental formation) of the energetic state imagined into an imagined, recraftable form.

But each moment is really on its own. Our relation to Being (the verb) is not the physicality that can be observed but the process of energetic observation. To me, it's a variable, another feeling between Being and an idea of a being at best, distractingly.

"Head" & "Heart" are metaphors for Text Consciousness & Vortex Consciousness

Did I grow up today? It remains to be seen - but I did iron out a deal for money. *sigh*

I don't know what people think of me. I just notice more and more how little I get.

It is our world that dies. We're here together, for the long haul.

A Dream
2 May 2015
4:00 AM

The room was dark and most of the kids were sleeping or trying to go to sleep. But she wanted to talk to me when I poked my head in to check on them.

"I'm one of them... like the 'laygolers'"

"What?" I asked. I didn't understand the word she said.

"Laygolers" she repeated.

I still didn't get it.

"Like the Stephen King book. 'Laygolers'"

"Oh" Oh. I didn't read that book. I remember a TV movie adaptation - I only saw little parts.

"Someday, someone will write a book. Not about me but with someone with my name. Two "o"s." Coori said.

"Come, help me open the window."

We tried. It was clamped tight. We opened the latch, but were having trouble with the screen. She worked on one side & I worked on the other. We had a little slot you had to move against a spring. We pushed hard, but it didn't move the screen. We over forced, bent it, and the screen fell out, tipped and tumbled into the house next door. We could see in, adults as children, playing a game, laughing.

The children in our heads never grow up. We're always trying to help them as if we can. Mulling about nights they were scared, thinking about events we could have handled differently. She's a Capricorn and I don't even know what that means.

I woke a little while ago from a vivid dream about a child - a daughter of mine when she was young.

I got up, peed, and quietly (there were maybe eight others asleep), in bunk beds, got clothes, my wallet, vest, and walked out to my car.

Blue channel now, that time when the sky is starting to get light where the sun will soon rise, but much of the sky is still dark. The sky shows a gradient of every color blue, deep dark blue to a pale sky blue. And every minute it changes greatly until it is down.

This is that auspicious time & magic time. A spiritual time, and here where I am in my car waiting, this is a spiritual place. The Chapel of Sacred Mirrors in Wappinger's Falls, NY. Something of a spiritual home for me. Not the only one, but a significant one. But isn't a Religion, what is religion, and what doesn't have to be.

I woke a little while ago from a vivid dream about a child - a daughter of mine when she was young.

I got up, peed, and quietly (there were maybe eight other guys sleeping) in bunk beds, got clothes, my wallet, vest, and walked out to my car.

Blue channel now, that time when the sky is starting to get light where the sun will soon rise, but much of the sky is still dark. The sky shows a gradient of every color blue, deep dark blue to a pale sky blue. And every minute it changes greatly until it is down.

This is that auspicious time & magic time. A spiritual time, and here where I am in my car waiting, this is a spiritual place. The Chapel of Sacred Mirrors in Wappinger's Falls, NY. Something of a spiritual home for me. Not the only one, but a significant one. But isn't a Religion, what is religion, and what doesn't have to do with spirituality & what does it have to do with my spirit? Now is the question I think of as well explore, as the light of the day invades the dark of night.

When I think of "Religion," I think of something like Judaism, a faith I was brought up in. I was brought up to identify with it. Somehow my name, my face, my hair, all said "Jew" from the day I was born on the ward on my birth certificate said it, peeing between my legs said it. By the time I was a week old, I was cut to conform to being a Jew.

But though my parents were not religious at all, they got a discount on nursery school if they joined the temple - it was based on, so they did. I learned Jewish stories, Jewish traditions, Jewish words, I learned Hebrew... well not really, I learned the alphabet and how to pronounce the words and by the time I was 13 I could read enough to be Bar Mitzvahed. Insert big party.

I wasn't done with Judaism either, but I wasn't convinced either. Religions seemed to claim they had the answers, wrapped in stories about how the world came to be the way it is now. So I kept going to religious school, in the Reform temple I'd been raised in. I was interested in the questions the books said it answered so I did my due diligence. But I didn't get it.

Alongside my Jewish upbringing, I was also going to public school and learning about science. Judaism had this character they kept talking about - God. The books said some interesting things, but they all ended with "something God said," and that was the end of it, where else to go? Just say the prayers and you could get the bread. Whatever.

Science had a different approach. If I observed things, I tried things out, took notes and could be used to do things, to build better tools, to make more precise measurements, etc. Before long, I favored science over religion. I wrote an essay in High School on why I didn't believe in God.

Then I went to college. I learned science as a scientist might, at least at the beginning stages. Math, Chemistry, Physics, separate fields but there was a clear progression of order in everything I saw, everything I touched. I learned of people, polished.

One night walking around my neighborhood home for thanksgiving and wandering in a light snow feeling like I was in the bottom of a beaker with a crystal precipitating out of solution. I fell to my knees in wonder and awe. I was looking into the street light where I felt rather than understood the order to all things in the universe. Each bit of energy, the annihilation of a B, of me, that I was a part of a wave pushing out of the earth through me. I was a huge molecule, a standing wave of energetic cycles.

---

## Entry 138: Existential Reflections & Philosophical Musings
*Date: 2024-02-01*

And - Strangely enough - I felt like God. Not "God" like the character in a story written a long time ago who if you eat and get the crystal energetic bacon but it is the light and presence that is the light in my eye seeing that light.

I went home and I tried to write down what I had seen, what I had felt, and it was inadequate. In the next year and a half, I wrote down revelations, I scribbled diagrams, I was trying to somehow convey in words, in metrics, and diagrams what I had learned in an instant, looking at that street light. I showed my work to my friends, and they didn't get it, showed it to my professors, and they told me to do my homework. I was getting discouraged until the first day of my first class in Buddhism.

Something in that class told me I wasn't alone. What I saw wasn't unique to me. This guy, the Buddha, saw it too. He was just a regular guy who noticed an extraordinary thing that was there all along. That is hidden everything yet is not visible. Ironically paradoxically it is the essence of vision itself.

Religions are the organizations built around spiritual experiences that other people have had. They come with stories that give a vocabulary to these experiences and the institutions of religion offer these stories to people who then use the vocabularies to explain and to a certain extent, constrain their own encounters with their own inner spiritual life. Science is not very different except that it develops stories about how the senses work and supplies a vocabulary to explain the world as it arrives at your senses.

For me, Buddhism is both and yet neither a religion nor a science. It does supply a useful framework and vocabulary to organize spiritual experience, it also offers a framework and vocabulary for organizing rigorous observation of the sensual world. Yet, the highest value in Buddhism is on personal practice, personal experience. It is through meditation that one is advised to watch the subtle workings of one's own mind. Below the wordy narration of life when people think of as "me", there is an energetic presence - What is me except an energetic presence? That is a void. It is emptiness as a dynamic force, not in a sense of a concrete thing, but in turning back to see what & who has decayed.

What has not changed is the inadequacy of words describing my experience. At best, it is all a metaphor. At best, Religion & Science alike are metaphors for what you are experiencing now as you trust in these words. You may be reading truth from a text, religious, scientific, or otherwise - but it is the inherent spiritual essence which is creating that truth, now in your mind.

May these words be a catalyst for your own truth, support for your own insights which are too subtle, and too precise to be put into words.

Truth cannot be written. It can only be read for it is the mind of the reader, the mind of the one who observes, who creates it. The sun has risen. Another day begins. Anyone can describe the sun, but only your energetic presence can feel it on your skin. Spirituality is presence that religions can only write about.

Introduction

This is my theory notebook, kept through the fall of 1980. I kept it around for when I'd get crazy ideas. Therefore, lots of the ideas are crazy.
Some of the ideas, I think, are interesting. Either way, this notebook gives a pretty fair overview of what I refer to as "theory."

Anyway, read what you think is interesting. I've tried to remember to put titles on these, but I've often forgot. I'd suggest looking at pages:
3 - The two forces
5 - Detection of movement & time
- Religion
16 - Facts & language
22 - Where are we?
23 - Universe of one charge
24 - Antimatter?
25 - Boundary of time (especially In Addition)
26 - Energy attracts Mass
27 - Unit of Time
42 - Energy transmission
44 - One at a time
45 - Representation of a person
51 - Antimatter Radiation & Time

The world is measured in discrete quanta. There are two types of quanta which exist in a complementary relationship, such that they constantly becom[e] the other in some regular time interval (frequency) and space interval (wavelength).

All real particles exhibit properties based on the balance of excess mass and energy quanta.

All energy quanta is balanced by an[other] correspond[ing] mass quanta, which are the inverse of one another. The energy quanta balance the charges in time between all similarly separate masses.

2 Types of Particles

There are two types of particles:
Those that have mass,
And those that don't.

A particle which has mass exists in a unique frame of reference, at a particular place in space. This particle, (balanced in time)* will always be at rest in space (in its own reference frame). This particle will move at constant velocity in time.
The constant velocity particles move in time in their own frames of reference is equal to the so-called speed of light.

A particle which has no mass exists in a unique frame of reference, at a particular instant in time. This particle (balanced in space)* will always be at rest in time (in its own frame of reference). This particle will move at constant velocity in space.
This constant velocity is also the speed of light.

Rest particles have characteristics of both mass and massless particles. They have velocity components in space and in time. The effects of changing the values of the components, and the interdependence due to the physical fact that it is a single vector (measured by both axes) cause all forces and their effects.

*both mean roughly "undisturbed"

Time and Space

It is possible to talk about Time without space. It is not possible however, to talk about space, without assumptions of time being made.

Time itself is not instantaneous. It propagates through space from one particle to another.
Each particle* moves from one value of time to the next.

* "particles" written with an overline, indicating a correction or emphasis.

The Two Forces

Gravity is the force of mass.
Electromagnetism is the force of energy.

Detection of movement in time.

Pure time is constantly advancing at a constant rate for any particle in its own frame of reference. However, this change can only be detected if there is some corresponding change in space
e.g. The hand of a clock moving or the beat of a heart.

[The end of the text is faded and not fully legible.]

At any present t(0), there is a frame of reference. There is a unique particle at rest in this frame. All other particles & the universe have a relative velocity.
A model of this particle could be as follows:
1) This particle has a method of interaction with all similar particles.
2) The universe of a particle is defined as all of the particles with which it is interacting.
3) The particle is interacting with all other particles of the universe, at every present t(x) time.
4) The particle has attractive and repulsive forces.
5) Every particle in the universe is either moving towards or moving away from the number moving at the same speed will be so few as to be ignored.

A model of the universe could be something along these lines.
Given a frame of reference anywhere within the universe, half the universe appears to be heading towards you, half away.
The half that is heading towards, can't be detected except its mass.
The half heading towards us is "visible" in the electromagnetic spectrum.

It's all past, present, and future.
Assume that there is an equal number of particles in the universe. Think of a particle as a string of events, connected through time.
Aside: this particle must be described by a continuous function of t.

The problem is, keeping the balance. The present is a manifold between the future and the past. Events from the future tend to present, then to the past. The trouble is, this unbalances the universe. Like a loan being taken out, sometime soon, the future has to be put back.
1) On the one dimensional level, this causes a particle to move in time.
2) This causes light two dimensional to stay at rest in time.
3) Causes us (3 dimensional) and the stars move in time.
4) This means our future must trend in the 7 dimensional universe.

Religion

We are matter, and God is energy.

There is a fundamental difference between what we talk about as "matter" and "energy."

There are different types of energy, there is kinetic energy and potential energy.
Kinetic energy is energy of motion while potential energy is energy contained in the surrounding frame of reference, some sort of field, like gravitational or electromagnetic.
Potential energy will appear different in different frames of reference.
Kinetic energy must be the same in all frames of reference.
Potential energy is energy contained within.
Kinetic energy is energy being expended, moving from one frame of reference to another.

Photons are pure kinetic energy.
Photons represent active God.

F=ma which represents fair play, conservation of time is the passive God.
The active God creates energy, as Parsec God supplies the endpoints, the 'cause' masses.

Einstein showed that all of Matter and Energy are one quantity. E=mc^2.
This proves that we are part of God.
He also set up the interactions of frames of reference. The placement of spatiotemporal coordinates are governed by stringent rules.
There must be an observer in the same 'universe' as whatever is being observed.
Only kinetic energy can be observed.
In every frame of reference, there is a point at which Ek=0 and Ep=∞.
In every frame of reference, there exists a finite amount of potential energy, the potential energy density is a value. There are points which approach zero and others that approach ∞.
We consider the frame of reference with ∞ Ep and 0 Ek to be the rest frame.
The frame of reference with Ek=0 is the 'moving' frame.

An infinite square well.

V=∞
V=0

Let's say the well exists with no energy in it.
In usual physics, the square well models of particles. This is my model for the present.

Think of what a square well is, in physics. It represents what happens as a particle exists through time.
Think of the infinite well as riding on the shockwave of time.
This particular infinite square well can be defined as the inertial frame.
Heisenberg's uncertainty principle defines the smallest dimensions of the electromagnetic.
We are electrons, quetz creatures.

[There is a hand-drawn diagram of an infinite square well with potential energy (V) against time (t), showing infinite potential at the walls and zero potential inside the well.]

The inertial frame is the present, moving through time.
The inertial frame has the space capacity for one unit of 'x' time.

An infinite square well becomes finite when time stops, if it would.

But Gravity will hold it all together.

The Principle of Equivalence can be taken farther. Not only can you say that there is no observable effect which could tell whether you are gravitationally held or are accelerating, but you should be able to state there really is no difference.

According to Einstein, Gravity can be viewed as the effect of the coordinate system.

If there was no previous flame, there will be no flame. I will not discuss the setting of a flame in this.

There exists a coordinate system in the inertial frame of the flame, where the flame is at rest, \( \frac{dx}{dt} = 0 \).
In the rest frame, we know also that over a period of time it will not change its position in space.

How can you ever state a pure fact? Any time you say something, there is a slant to it. It seems straight to you, but in the language you use, the expression you use, the tone of your voice, you bend the fact into a piece of yourself.

General Relativity holds over 4-dimensional space. Its effects can only be measured over large spacetime intervals. Newtonian mechanics is based on 3 dimensions. Electromagnetism: two dimensions. Special Relativity describes the ideal case of one dimension. The only change is in time. No change in space.

What are we?
What is all we need to know?
It has to be simple and exact.
Let's say a particle has an exact space-time position, and an exact velocity (momentum). How could either quantity be determined?
The momentum can be found by crashing the particle against a detector.
This is a change in momentum. An acceleration. This will subsequently change the space the position of the particle.
The position of the particle can be detected by shining a light beam onto it and having it reflect back, but this would change the momentum.

Introduction
Goals
A) Goals of Philosophy
1) Description of reality, including reasons for existence
2) Based on self-consistent axioms
3) Axioms should be as simple as possible.
4) Results should be as far-reaching as possible
B) Goals of Science - Since Newton
1) Satisfied with the description.
2) Also based on self-consistent axioms
3) Increasingly complex mathematics used
   a) tend to overshadow a conceptual understanding of the actual physical phenomena.
4) If a new phenomenon is observed which doesn't fit EX, start a new branch of science with new laws.
C) An ideal result
   1) If there exists one single law governing all phenomena, what would it be?
   2) This would be the most philosophically pleasing result, due to its simplicity (Occam's Razor).
   3) It should also be self-defining (recursive).
   4) It should apply to everything.
D) No compromise

Where are we? Once we develop a system of description of the 'objective universe,' it will always be only a general solution, without specifying the representation of our physical forms.
My view of the universe is that the topography of space-time as described by General Relativity is a framework in which any description of physical forms must be construed.
In infinitesimal regions, the rules of Special Relativity hold. Here, the topography of space-time has been flattened. A particle within a very small region [...]

Universe of One Charge

In a universe of one charge, every particle in the universe would be accelerating away from all other particles.

A Model:
Some charged point P with some mass M associated with it pops into being at some time \( t_0 \). Assume there is no binding force on the constituent masses in the point.

At time \( t_0 \), there would exist in space a point. We will assume space in this case has 3 dimensions, arbitrarily.

A sphere of commonly charged particles would grow around the original space point.

Assuming the classical laws of electromagnetism hold, the charged particle at \( t_0 \) would give off an electric field. This field would travel through space, expanding in a sphere around the original spatial point, at the speed of light.

The constituent masses of the original point will be mutually accelerated away from one another.

[There is a hand-drawn diagram with a central point labeled P, surrounded by concentric circles representing the expanding sphere of charge. There are also axes labeled \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \), representing the three-dimensional space.]

Antimatter?

There are some cosmologists who lose sleep over the fact that they can't find any antimatter.

I think it's very simple. It's all right here.

Each charge could be thought of as accelerating away from like charges, without ever being affected by unlike charges in any way.
(This could be done by representing the opposite charge as a lower density of the original charge.)
This theory of electromagnetism would work out equivalent, I believe, to classical electromagnetism.
The electric field, then, would behave only as a repulsive field. Therefore the universe would expand forever were there only one charge.
However, the fact that some conservation law causes opposite fields to be always equal in number and strength, keeps objects around us, including ourselves, from expanding to infinity. We are electrically balanced.

Seen from within a single charge universe, it can see only objects of the same charge.

Boundary of Time

\( E_k = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \) for objects moving slower than light
\( E_f = hv \) for light

For a mass m in the ground state (absolute zero), its velocity, therefore its kinetic Energy is zero.

Relativity shows that as the velocity increases the "speed" in time decreases until \( \frac{v}{c} \Delta t = 0 \).

Therefore,
Max \( \Delta t \) is at absolute zero
Min \( \Delta t \) is at the speed of light. (=0)

This forms very definite bounds for energy in our universe.

In Addition
All forms of energy which we can interact with are forms of electromagnetic energy. The speed of light is an aspect of electromagnetism.
This could mean that the rate of time is an aspect of our energy system, rather than of space-time as a whole.

Energy attracts Mass

Time has direction. Only in a gravitational field is there a preferred direction, which is the direction of time.
In an inertial frame, while there is some unique direction of mass to become from some other inertial frame.

In the gravitational field, time has a direction from mass towards energy.

The unit of time for any closed energy system can be taken as the time it takes for one unit of mass to become one unit of energy.

For electromagnetism, the electron volt is one unit of mass and one electron volt is one unit of energy.

Any event which occurs must be an integral number of time units.

For any unit of time to exist, a unit of anti-time must exist as well.
One unit of anti-time is the time it takes for one unit of energy to become one unit of mass.

In an anti-time gravitational field, the time vector points from energy to mass.

For physical significance of This,
Let's look at earth.
According to General Relativity, the higher up in earth's gravitational field, the faster time moves, and vice versa. This indicates that time is moving upwards. In the case where the gravitational field is due to acceleration, the direction of time is the direction of accelerated motion.

There being a direction for time does not necessitate there being any units of time moving from mass to energy. It only requires that if there is a motion between mass and energy, that is the direction time takes.
Space and time are the containers of mass and energy.

Mass and energy are something else. They are more specific than space and time. There's no experiment we can perform to obtain information about space and time without using mass and energy.

The mass and energy in our universe, in order for us to learn about it, must be electromagnetic in nature.

## Entry 149: White RPI Notebook Recognizing
*Date: 2024-02-03*

Unit of Time

The unit of time is a single value; a scalar. This is the only form of communication across time, in any single closed energy system.

At any single instant in time, there exists values of mass. Every unit of mass which exists in one instant must proceed to the next instant along geodesics in space-time.

In our closed energy system of electromagnetism, every unit of mass also has a quality known as charge*. This charge quality must also be transmitted through the unit of time.

I would like now to emphasize that the unit of time is a messenger provided by space-time, not the mass-energy system. Mass only exists at infinitesimal intervals of time, and depends on the geometry and the unit for existence.

For the unit mass and unit charge, the unit time will be some constant interval ΔS.

Also, the unit of time is a markov process, at that the ΔS depends only on the previous state.

*Noting I purposely do not introduce a distinction of sign of charge.

An Instant of Time and the Inertial Frame of Reference

At some infinitesimal unit of the dΣ, the three space dimensions are not affected by any gravitational field which might exist in the area.

This can be easily visualized by thinking of the action of the gravitational field as a gradient in the rate of change of time.
If time is a changing value, it can be thought of as being a function of some unknown variable \( X(\aleph) \). So we have \( X(\aleph), \frac{d\aleph}{dt} = d\theta \).
Motion purely in space is absolutely forbidden. This would make it possible for objects to be at two or more places in space at the same time simultaneously. This is something not experienced in everyday world and it was a main objective for special relativity to prevent.
This is also intuitively obvious from Newtonian mechanics, since all motion in space is a function of time.

Unit Model.

mass = 1, charge = 1, at some \( t = t_0 \)

There exists an operation which changes the time from \( t = t_0 \) to \( t = t_1 \), 

mass m = 1, \( \text{charge} = q = 1 \) at some \( t = t_1 \),

\[ \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 \\
0 & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}
m \\
q \\
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
m_2 \\
q_e \\
\end{bmatrix} \]

For the coordinates of this unit in time is the product of the matrices.

\[ \begin{bmatrix}
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}
\Delta x \\
\Delta y \\
\Delta z \\
\Delta t \\
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
x \\
y \\
z \\
t \\
\end{bmatrix} \] or symbolically, \( \Delta S = X \)

where the matrix A describes the current state of the coordinates x_0, y_0, z_0, t_0, and can be solved either for the change in coordinates, given the final coordinates, or for the final coordinates, given the change in the coordinates.

In this case \( A = I \), the identity matrix indicating that we consider this system as being at rest at the origin of the coordinate system. A physical particle in such a state would have zero kinetic energy. In our universe, this would be how a particle at absolute zero could be represented.

Some Solutions.

Let us picture particles in various states of motion:
First, a particle will be considered some volume within which the special theory of relativity will hold, an inertial frame of reference.

We will consider all particles beginning at time \( t_0 \) as being at the origin of space-time.

\[ \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}
\Delta x \\
\Delta y \\
\Delta z \\
\Delta t \\
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
x \\
y \\
z \\
t \\
\end{bmatrix} \] or \( IX = X \)

This is merely a number which switches the units of time into units of space.

This can easily be generalized for a system which can be solved in general situations for its eigen-values and eigen-vectors.
\[ AX = \lambda X \]

\( \lambda \) being the vector representing the change in space-time coordinates, it's an eigen-vector.
A represents a particle. If the particle is observable, we know that there will be at least one real eigenvalue for which the eigen-vector is also real.

Space-Time

Space-time can be thought of as two mutually perpendicular complex planes.
The parameters of a particle are a combination of the two planes, but in order to measure one, the other must be affected.

The real axes together form electromagnetism, including charge. The imaginary axes contain time, and mass.

The Basics

Q: What are we trying to show?

Speculation: A particle at rest will tend to stay at rest. After any motion, a particle must transform itself back into a coordinate system where it's at rest.

What effect on this has any physical attributes like mass and charge? What effect do the attributes have on the transformation?

Assumption:

All physical properties of a particle must be represented by a matrix of 4 equations in 4 unknowns. They can be thought to represent the boundaries of a region in space-time. The shape of the region, including volume, radius, etc., would determine.

The universe is the sum of all possible tensors in four dimensions (n=4).

The universe can be represented as an n×n matrix of space-time coordinates. The world line of some particle moving through it, as a function of time.

The coordinates of the universe are invariant to causal order.
A new coordinate system for the universe must be created for every point in the matrix.

[The Uncertainty Principle]
ΔxΔp ≥ ℏ/2
Establishes a relationship between momentum and space.
Because also Δp = mΔv and Δv = Δx/Δt for some small Δt,
This expresses a relation between space and time.
The momentum of a particle is absolute to itself, but relative to anything else.
As velocity goes to zero, p will go to zero.

[Momentum]
In classical physics, p = mv²
Special Relativity proved that in more general cases,
p = mv/√(1-v²/c²)
The rest of the first equation becomes a function μ(m,v) which at v=0, μ=m.
μ = m/√(1-v²/c²)
Now, \(\vec{v} = \frac{d\vec{x}}{dt}\) where x is some vector.
If \(\vec{v} ≠ 0\), then in the coordinate system of the vector, it is changing position.

[Definition of a Particle]
A particle occupies a single frame of reference in space, with three coordinates.
The particle can be described by a tensor. The tensor is the transformation of that particle into time.
There must also be a vector in time, which gives the particle an extension in time.
All the qualities of a particle must be couched within the space-time boundaries of what we consider a particle.
The particle must be in motion in space-time. Else it would not be moving in either the space or time phase.
Therefore, the particle has some velocity V_ST, which will mean space-time velocity.
If there is some function f(x,y,z,t) where x, y, and z are dependent variables, and t is independent, where s(x,y,z,t) is the position of the particle at any given time t,
so that V_ST = ds/dt = f'(x,y,z,t)

[Space-Time]
V_ST = f'(x,y,z,t)
m should be the time component of the space-time interval of the particle.
q is the space component of the space-time interval of the particle.

[Time and Space]
The particle, which is represented by coordinates m in a 4x4 space, is immersed in a sea of other particles.
We will assume that the universe as a whole is conservative with respect to both m and q. This means that ∫m_i=0, ∫q_i=q_i.
Mass is a function of time so ∫m(t)dt=0 and q is a function of space, so ∫q(x)dx=0
Mass and charge are the most fundamental properties of a particle. They exist prior to any environmental effects could affect the particle.
Assume that there exists a quanta of mass and charge... a single quanta.
This quanta would be a space-time interval of definite extension in space-time, but could resolve in any way by the two components.
It is possible to have pure mass with no charge OR to have pure charge with no mass.

[Energy Transmission]
According to accepted theory regarding particles on the order of one angstrom, in order for that particle to emit a signal, it must lose energy. A particle which receives a signal increases in energy.

Energy can be considered a function of time, such as:
E = hν or E = mc²
Where ν and c are both related to time.

Let us assume that this is a fundamental universe. Each particle at a particular energy views the universe as flat.
Every particle constantly watches the universe to make sure the universe stays flat.
Every time a signal is sent, a hole appears in the universe.
What the signal's message is the size of the hole.
The signal can only be received by particles which are at the same energy level as the new particle.

In a discussion of these particles, definitions are necessary of time, energy, space, and matter.
Space is the fabric of distance. The distance must be measured at a single instant in time to enhance accuracy.
Time is the possibility of change.
Energy is the change or transformation from one energy level to another.
Matter is the number of units of mass the particle has. It loses mass

[Small Theory]
A single particle has properties: m and E.
Between two particles exist interactions: G and Q.

The representation of a particle should give some representation of the properties of a particle purely in terms of spacetime.
The representation for all other particles in a single particle's frame of reference must explain observed interactions in terms of the mass and energy of the other particles.

[One at a Time]
Due to the theory of relativity, there is an inherent limit to our observation about any single instant of time.
At the heart of this is the way we think about time. We can only be at one place at a time.
Classical physics demands that a particle moves along an exact worldline, and at any instant t that particle will be at some exact position P_t.

Time and Space
The particle which is represented by coordinates m in a 4x4 space, is immersed in a sea of other particles.
We will assume that the universe as a whole is conservative with respect to both m and q. This means a sum of all particles in the universe with respect to m and q will yield 0.

Mass and charge are the most fundamental properties of a particle. They exist prior to any environmental effects could affect the particle.
Assume that there exists a quanta of mass and charge... a single quanta.
This quanta would be a space-time interval of definite extension in space-time, but could resolve in any way by the two components.
It is possible to have pure mass with no charge OR to have pure charge with no mass.

*Date: 2024-02-03*

[Time and Space - m and q]
- The particle is represented by coordinates m in a 4x4 space, immersed in a sea of other particles.
- The universe is assumed to be conservative regarding m (mass) and q (charge), implying the sum of all particles with respect to m and q equals zero.
- Mass is a function of time, and charge is a function of space, suggesting that the integral of m(t) over time and q(x) over space is zero.
- Mass and charge are intrinsic to a particle, existing before any environmental effects.
- It's postulated that a single quantum of mass and charge exists, which could be a spacetime interval with definite extension in spacetime, allowing for resolution in any way by its two components.
- It's possible to have pure mass with no charge or pure charge with no mass.

[Energy Transmission]
- The theory posits that a particle must lose energy to emit a signal and gains energy when receiving a signal.
- Energy is considered as a function of time (E = hν or E = mc²).
- It's hypothesized that particles view the universe as flat at a specific energy level and constantly work to maintain this flatness.
- When a signal is sent, it manifests as a hole in the universe, and the size of the hole is indicative of the signal's message.
- Signals can only be received by particles at the same energy level as the new particle.

[Discussion of Particles, Time, Energy, Space, and Matter]
- Space is defined as the fabric of distance, measured at a single instant to enhance accuracy.
- Time is the possibility of change.
- Energy is the transformation from one energy level to another.
- Matter is quantified by the units of mass a particle possesses and is subject to loss.

[Small Theory]
- A single particle possesses properties m (mass) and E (energy).
- Interactions between particles are represented by G (gravitational?) and Q (charge?).
- The representation of a particle should express its properties purely in terms of spacetime.
- This representation should also explain observed interactions in terms of the mass and energy of other particles.

[One at a Time]
- Relativity imposes a limit on observation about any single instant of time.
- We are confined to being at only one place at a time.
- Classical physics asserts that a particle follows a precise worldline, existing at a specific position at any given instant.

[Representation of a Person]
- A person is considered a particle and thus should have an idealized description in spacetime.
- A person is represented as a sphere and is considered to be at rest in space, assuming General Relativity treats them as in an infinitesimal region of space-time.
- At each instant of time, a person exists at one place in space and can only sense or think of one thing at a time.

[Considerations on a Thermodynamic Representation in Spacetime]
- There is a thermodynamic equilibrium in space with equal numbers of heat sources and heat sinks.
- The universe consists of all matter and energy in a point of space-time with a finite amount of mass.
- As time passes, this point expands into a sphere, with the assumption that all constituent masses were electrically charged equally.
- At any small differential of time throughout the universe, there is a measure of the energy or the overall temperature.
- The diameter of the universe at any time value would have a definite value.
- Humans have limitations on how much they can sense in one unit of time.

[General Relativity's View of the Universe]
- General Relativity allows every point mass in the universe to be considered the center of the universe, with each having its own coordinate system.
- The universe at any instant in time is a sphere.
- The space-time representation of any one particle is a system of spheres called a hypercone, governed by the relation \( ds^2 = dx^2 - c^2dt^2 \).
- The present is the apex of the past cone and is pure mass with no extension in space. It's the only property that allows for change; any change in momentum must occur in the present.
- The future is described as a wave of possibilities, signifying potential outcomes and paths.

[Quantized Time Particle Model]
- Imagining a particle in quantized time, using the previously discussed model of the universe.
- Each unit time distance from the center represents quanta of a specific wavelength, equating to the universe's temperature at that time.
- Particles are depicted as existing in spacetime, with any distance in time from the center also representing a distance in space.

[Present Point and its Isolation]
- The present point of a particle is completely isolated from the rest of the universe, representing the perpetual present of the particle.
- This isolation in time is likened to a sphere in space, with every point having energy.
- The energy must be retrieved into mass before the next present can occur, illustrating how time can be quantized.

[Sphere of Space]
- The sphere of space is defined by a volume of \( \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \) and a surface area of \( 4\pi r^2 \), with \( r = ct \) representing the radius in terms of light-speed and time.
- This representation is part of the model for understanding the quantization of spacetime and its components.

[Flame Dynamics and Representation Systems]
- Flames must die out eventually due to thermodynamics.
- The author critiques the complexity added by various representation systems (e.g., past/present/future, cold/medium/hot, solid/liquid/gas, slow/fast) and suggests simplifying these systems.

[Antimatter, Radiation, and Time]
- Combines the problems of antimatter and energy radiation from matter.
- Proposes that mass in an atom is concentrated at the nucleus, suggesting using the nucleus-electron cloud distance to measure time.
- Defines antimatter as matter moving backward in time, with its interaction with matter resulting in the complete release of energy.
- Suggests that energy emission is a small annihilation of matter and antimatter, and absorption is the production of the same.

[Quantized Time and Electron Dynamics]
- Each bit of mass has a "time field" around it; if time is quantized, each unit time would have different energy.
- When an electron emits a photon, it's moving "back in time" in the local time field of the nucleus; absorption is moving "forward in time."
- Notes that an atom not interacting with energy (where electrons are "not moving in time") is consistent with experimental observations and theoretical models like Bohr's and quantum physics.
- Relativity's effects on the time field take precedence over electromagnetic effects.

Metaphor

Even though we often see people in public with clothes on, we know the clothes do not make up them. They can take them off, yet they exist just as much.

In the same way, we may talk to people though we don't relate to or observe them unmasked. They strip away all of those layers of affiliations, titles, even their name - they are still a biological organism, just like me. No intellect required.

And like people talk, if their clothes, people without words without an intellect identity, everything can connect. I'm not restricted to a room with other people with the known word of connection. I interact with each other, an intimate level not possible with mere words as talking.

## Entry 160: Who Am I? to Conservation of Agency Notebook
*Date: 2024-02-22*

Who Am I?

Every sentence is both an answer and an echo of that question.

Indeed, what we accept as the answer to that question is the form of ourself that we think we are, and the echo of that form is what we think the world we live in is.

Each moment, we have a unit of Agency, which must be used each conscious moment.

Only a single subject can experience Consciousness. Agency implies a conscious experience takes place, one moment of consciousness at a time. If Agency of more than one Being are tuned through some resonant signals, then multiple beings can act as one Being and all can be modelled through the Agency of layers of Being.

2

Why is it so hard for people to understand the world, when so many other natural biological creatures seem to be shaped by their DNA to know how to use their agency in the world?

I don't feel I can really understand the world, but I can see how the world works inside myself. While many scales with great accuracy through instruments we can observe many types of agency at many levels from the outside, each person has only a single subject where they can research how Being works on the inside.

3

Language, as we know it in the 21st century, is at best a hostile witness. It is a powerful tool to multiply your knowledge by the word of how people going back through history. However, the way it is used is unpredictable and most of the time difficult to come by how the styles of understanding language are all too easily manipulated en masse, which defeats the purpose of actual common usages.

This is indeed foretold in the story of the tower of Babel. But the way language as the tool designed by humans most specifically in written language has now become the motivating factor in how persons use the agendas of people as tools to do written goals.

5

Conservation of Agency

Using the Being in a Field of Being model of the world.

All that exists and are able to interact through a Field of Being are Beings.

All Beings are resonant on frequencies through a Field of Being.

A Being goes through three Phases in each conscious moment.

Interaction → Sense Field Change
Integration → Understand Change
Reaction → Make Field Change

Interaction with the Field is accessed by conscious agency through a Being's senses. Integration is when memory of the Field is interacted with changes sensed. Reaction is a resulting effect induced by the Being through their corporeal connection to the Field of Being.

## Entry 161: Identity, Control, and Reflection
*Date: 2024-04-13*

The notebook is the pad I carry around waiting for the point of the pen. It doesn't care who is writing, or what is written. It's job is simply to be blank – the horizon against which the pen can cross out thin lines of blankness.

The notebook knows no time. Its pages and lines are equally available at all moments. A notebook is never finished until it is burned or buried or lost – for only then can nothing more be added.

Of course, duplication makes the notebook something else. It freezes a moment in the process that is a notebook. Suddenly, the notebook becomes a book.

So who has control over this? I could say "me," but who is this me? Is it the body which wrote the word down just now, or the "I" extended through time back to my personal birth? Let's just say that I am an individual, self-identical, extended over time, who has control over this? Don't the people who affect what I have at my command also have control, then in this sense, other people within how do I decide how to use it? What to write down about myself? What about the influence of the world – the signs which cause thoughts and actions to erupt from me? Do I really have control over those actions, or are those actions me?

What about dreams or mistakes?

What is this, anyway?

Show you, so that you may judge it, and write a better book.

This book has to be tight – like the new music, like the new movies. It has to hold the attention of the reader to prove its point, that the reader does have ultimate control of what is being read, and thus over themselves. What this book (book now, not notebook anymore) is about is what the world is like as viewed from the perspective you might ask, who am I being? I can answer without any pressure. I am from the perspective of any single being? I would ask you, why shouldn't I? Don't you? If you think you don't – I'd say, it's because you've been listening to what others have been telling you to believe. This doesn't mean that understanding the world and the universe is easy – rather it's hard for different reasons. I'm not saying I have all the answers, but I have glimpsed and can recall a path that satisfies me. This book is my attempt to – [Some words are obscured by ink blotches]

All systems which define some actions as good and others as bad have a common problem: that the existence and occurrence of the bad actions are as crucial for the system as the existence and occurrence of the good actions. For example, how would an ethical system develop with a basic principle that life is sacred? People simply living together and conflict with each other without a great deal of thought to the particular worth of life until they realized that they have the ability to kill each other at will, for whatever reason. At this point, they would be forced to bring in good and bad, for by saying "life is sacred" it means that saving a life is good, while killing a life is bad.

I'm getting bored with writing.

It's because I'm hardly saying anything at all.

Of course, maybe that's something, in itself.

It is impossible to determine exactly where my tax dollar (this one here with a little rip under the left one) goes. It completely loses its identity in the coffers of the government.

This is the same as what time does to matter.

Feel like I'm playing monopoly, paying the rent, the phone bill, and heat.

Universality of aesthetics

People have different likes and dislikes but there is something in aesthetics which is universal. Musical laws are true for everyone. Beauty is often culturally bound, but balance is universal.

---

An intuitive understanding of aesthetics exists in all people but for rational minds to use aesthetics, it must be exercised.

Analysis is necessary in aesthetics to fully understand actions in the world. Judgments of actions are far more meaningful when people in general and the subjects of the action in particular are known. Facts rationally correlated and understood are essential to any ethical theory. Still, an aesthetic understanding is necessary using the results of the analysis in an aesthetic judgment.

---

"Social Artists"
- Everyone should be such an artist.

---

Utilitarianism asks you to step back from the world and analyze an action by extrapolating the probable results of the action. Therefore, the Utilitarian decision is one not made in the world as it is, but a decision made in an abstracted world of the future using analysis of as many facts as are deemed appropriate. An aesthetic decision would be based as much as possible on acting in the world, and an intuitive understanding of them.

"I think there's some good stuff in this magazine. Not too much, but some."

A wonderful weekend, with a sword poised over both our heads.
I should have been stronger.

I should have made her work!
I should have made myself work.

But it all seemed such a perfect picture, as we flowed through the world with each other, at hand. And we never forgot what had to be done. It was always there, when we were ready for it.

Now, we're back to business. Let's show them we can play their game too, so we can get back to ours. It will be even prettier, next time.

I'm being bad but I can't help it. I don't know what to do! I know that person over there drinking coffee slowly, alone at that table, but I don't know his name, and I forgot to nod at him or smile or anything when he saw me see him so... what can I do now? I'm so afraid of him I want to fold up into myself like a turtle in its shell peering out with scaly eyes on a world it is separate from. He makes me cold and scared of turning around for he might still be there, waiting for my friendly return. I want to cry and run away and hold Tina tight in my arms, stroke her hair and taste her cool breath surround me in warmth.

"It's just understanding how things work. If you understand, you do what's right."

"It's not a conspiracy."

"I know... everyone knows that."

Connection.

When two people can think of the same idea, without knowing each other, without communication.

You know you are the other person.

You are your thoughts.

You are anywhere your thoughts are.

You are anywhere your light is.

"I feel writing"

Some things I feel proper to do, even when I'm alone.

Some things I feel proper to do, when I'm with people.

If there was no other, it would not be either proper or improper. There would be no proper at all.

We are God, on vacation.

Everybody knows everybody.

You wouldn't steal from someone you know, as long as you trust them.

Your eyes are where you see that's where your mind is focused.

Tricky thing about time, "if my watch is right..."

An alternative definition of simultaneity would involve a postulate about time instead of space. (but a postulate indicated appropriate by the results of relativity)

As a guiding principle, ask "What is the world?" "How do I see it?"

Show there were other legitimate options which were not used for lack of proper considerations.

"what is" is "becoming what is"

It is a horrible crime to trivialize a civilization.

Tina is very, very beautiful. Especially when I see her.
No... she's always beautiful.

pure observers move only in time, not in space, in their own frames of reference.

Motion is observed in others when, relatively, they have a special component to their motion.

Every observer has some momentum vector.

Changing the momentum of an observer unbalances it in its own frame of reference. It must bring itself back to rest.

A frame of reference is a perspective on the universe, at the "point" observer.

The "past" state of the universe, the "present" action of the observer, and the resulting "future" state of the universe are all joined together as one at the point observer.

---

Only changes in momentum can be observed.
The space component of an object is its energy.
The time component of an object is its mass.
Changes in momentum occur due to collisions between objects.
Two objects in collision must exist in the same present.

---

How many do you answer to, even when the others are not around?

—On a rocky cliff, overlooking the tents.

"I heard the first few who went through died. In perfect condition, but they just died. They said it was the brain... all the charges were balanced, so there was no kick to get the heart going again! Every bodily system was stopped."

"That’s why they use the shock?"

"Yep. We don’t die, now."

"We... Live."

"Yeah. On the wrong side of a shattered mirror." I snorted and stood up, nudging some stones over the edge, smiling at the clinks down the side, to clouds on the ground.

—looked up at the pulsing red nebolomic sky and wondered about before the flash.

Resonance

Every subuniverse is complete and independent in and of itself.

Subuniverses connect with other subuniverses in the universe through resonance.

Sympathetic vibrations, through the communication of music.

A specific photon will trigger at very specific energy levels. This determines the energy of the photon (quantized) but there is other information: the direction of the photon, which could be the color or note also.

It is the thickness of the photon that determines the frequency (time rate).

---

Gravity is the tendency of "mass" back in time.

Heat flows to cold. This is an effect of gravity.

Electromagnetism is the tendency of "mass" forward in time.

Gravity keeps the universe at complete equilibrium at all observable times.

Electromagnetism keeps the universe moving up.

---

Mass exists in subuniverses.

The mass of a subuniverse is determined by the number of "time sources".

I am opinionated, but one of my opinions is that I have no opinions.

Our mind is the controller of the body. Every muscle is paired with one neuron to control that muscle. To have perfect control of our minds we must attain perfect control of our bodies.

The nerves from the senses are different pathways than the nerves out to the muscles. Impulses flow only in one direction.

We see in one space, act in another.

Still, for us it "seems" the same subuniverse.

---

An observer with only one time source in its subuniverse can only move one "mass" forward in time.

That one mass forward in time brings all signals from all other subuniverses in. The observer is a perspective of all the universe.

The observer "sees" other subuniverses with the same mass. Through resonance, their rates in time correspond.

motion in time is carried on:
    emag -> (forward)
    (backward) <- gravity

---

All phenomena are music, created by the time sources.

All time sources should sing as much as they listen.

People are time sources, but there are so few musicians among us these days. We are satisfied to just watch and listen.

Mind-body... The intersection is consciousness.

Energy-mass... The intersection is sensation, the complementary change in either.

The generalized relationship is the same, between Mind & Body, between Energy and Mass.

Quantum mechanics treats everything like Energy.
General Relativity treats everything like Mass.

Everything is really both.

We see ourselves as only mass, while the rest of the universe is only energy.

If it all starts with whole states of consciousness, how do we break things up? How do we discern objects? How do we isolate pain to a particular part of our body? How do we control individual parts of our body? How do we store complex activities ready at simple recall, like writing or talking?

    I taste... wonderful. I smell beautiful... I feel warm. I feel warm at pleasure. I hear music... I see colorful sunset and I sink and I...

    and I...

    and I am alone and cannot see darkness or anything else and lights flicker on inside.

    Maec walks into building and places a silver on a stone counter surrounding devices to deliver food for money. A large, crunchy apple is handed back.
    Maec eats it.
        I taste happy.

    Maec learns to grow trees and chase rabbits and make a fire and to cook and to converse with other people who look the same and look different from each other. Maec sees mirror.
        I see myself see myself see my... see my... see... see...

    Drink the old juice of grapes and wander through chilling winds laughing.
        Love and feel the smile of pleasure grip me.

    Maec learns...
        I learn...
            I understand these words of Maec.

## Entry 184: Ants on the Wall
*Date: 2024-05-30*

Cycle of nerves...

    we feel something, it is "felt" and we respond.
            feeling
     ↘️                   ↗️
        consciousness
     ↖️                   ↘️
          response

    a cell either feels or responds, not both. impulses travel in nerves in only one direction.

    "It's a beautiful instrument, heavy and hand made, on Tidoom."
    "It looks nice... do you have the standard information?"
    "Of course."
    "Let me see it on crystal, for Dreelge."

    I miss you already and we’re barely three hours apart. Not knowing what to do, I am a ship becalmed without a rudder... yet anxious to get somewhere, to do something... to see you again and show you what I've done.

    This is terrible, I know. I shouldn’t be putting this pressure on you. These responsibilities are mine, and I must do them for me, but somehow you enrich me, and likewise enrich all that I do. Your presence in my mind enhances all I do.

    Still, this childish pining helps nothing, and only adds to my impotence to act. I love you, Tina; but for now I must put you somewhat out of my mind, as you must abandon me, to attack the problems of the day. Soon, always soon, we will be together again.

    "Do you want anything to drink?" Ned asked Sue, sitting in her apartment.
        She looked up from the class notes she was copying over and looked at him blankly.
    "Water maybe? Or how about orange juice?" Ned continued.
    "Do you want anything?" Sue asked.
    "Yeah, I'd really like some orange juice."
    "Well, I'll have some too while you're getting it," Sue said, smiling now, and turning back to her notes. But "Oh, I think we're out of juice."
        "There's a can in the freezer."
        "Oh... you don't have to make it. I just want water."

        He made the orange juice, and brought two glasses.

    Suffering, like boundaries, is a product of our perception, consciousness.
        You can always change your attitude... your desires.

## Entry 187: Time Conservation Request
*Date: 2024-06-24*

Time is a subject, a quantity, an entity; exhaustively studied, but still not very well understood. In physics, it is a fundamental dimension of the universe, and a constituent of the medium in which we all exist. It cannot really be called a physical quantity, but it regulates all physical quantities. Philosophers from the beginning of time have pondered the nature of time, and how it relates to life and man's role in the cosmos. In this paper, I will set forth a concept called the Conservation of Time, and try to get some answers for those age-old questions.

Historically, there have been several theories of time. Notably, there first came the Aristotelian view, which said that time is an absolute to all, independent of reference frame. It worked fine for hundreds of years, but finally ran into troubles when confronted with the discoveries of the late nineteenth century.

Einstein came up with the idea that time is relative for observers in different frames of reference. He was also the first to show that time is an equal partner with space in the makeup of what we now call the space-time continuum. Einstein's ideas revolutionized all branches of science, the full implications of which have yet to be realized. In this paper, I will use Relativity along with reasoning to arrive at conclusions beyond even the scope of General Relativity.

## Conservation of Time

General Relativity demonstrates that time and mass are intrinsically related, giving rise to the phenomenon of gravity. The vector properties of time are also divulged. In the Conservation of Time, it is useful to view time as emanating from a point mass. An illustration of this would be to consider a lightbulb as such a mass. If the lightbulb started off, then was flicked on for just an instant, a shell of light would surround the lightbulb, propagating outward 'at the speed of light.' (which I will refer to as the speed of time.) The time, in relation to the lightbulb, of any point on this shell will be the same as any other point on the shell. Because all of the times are equal, this would be an isochronal surface. Any other shell constructed with the lightbulb at the center will also be an isochronal surface. The fact that the light was turned on was only for illustration purposes. Time is moving regardless of whether it can be seen or not, in this model. In my previous paper, I tried to show how light was at rest in time. Here you can visualize how the photons are placed on an isochronal surface, and then the surface expands around its origin, like a shockwave.

Another type of isochronal surface is one which is not expanding and remaining at the same point in time, as all surfaces that photons adhere to do, but a surface which stays at a constant distance from its time source, and is moving through continuous values of time. The surface of the earth is such a surface. It is isochronal in the sense that anything at the surface is equidistant from the time source, therefore the surface is synchronized.

Picture a sphere of water, with its center of mass at its center, and no other gravitational bodies nearby. Time at the surface of this sphere is moving happily away from the center, and the water is perfectly still. Now let's say someone throws a pebble into this spherical pond. This will cause ripples to propagate around the sphere in time. These ripples are an example of conservation of time. The ripple consists of water slightly below surface level, and water slightly above it. It is easy to show that at any instant all around the sphere there will be an equal volume of water above the (at rest) surface as below it. Stated, Conservation of Time means for every instant of time moved in one direction, an equal amount must move in the opposite direction. While the surface was at rest, the water was at an equilibrium point in time. After it was disturbed, the chronal equilibrium was preserved through the conservation. For each bit of water that was pushed ahead in time, a bit was pushed back in time, in reference to the center of the sphere.

There are many common examples of Conservation of Time, which is a reason it is so philosophically pleasing. It is so simple, yet it explains so much. Walking conserves time; as one foot goes forward, the other goes back, yet we manage to move farther ahead. Fish swim by moving their fins one way, then the other, but they move straight ahead. Birds move their wings up and down, but still fly. On a more philosophical level, men are one direction in time, women another. Together they add

to a zero, which is not nothing, but a starting point, where life can begin.

In our daily lives, for the most part, time is also conserved. We get up in the morning, go to school, or work, or whatever, do whatever we do, and eventually go home at night to the same bed. A circle in space and time. In this case, it is possible to consider that bed as the time source, so however far you traveled from it, time was conserved and you went back. Any paths that involve closed paths conserve time. The earth's orbit around the sun is such a path. Each of our own paths around the axis of the earth as it spins each day is another such path.

If you take a bottle of baby shampoo and shake it, lots of bubbles of all different sizes will appear uniformly. If the bottle is left to settle, the larger bubbles quickly move to the surface of the liquid, while the smaller bubbles will move more slowly upward. This is more than just a weird way to bide your time in the shower, it is an interesting case of Conservation of Time. What we see as the bubble is actually only the absence of shampoo. The bubble is defined by the liquid along the outside of it. What we see as the bubble moving up is actually the liquid moving down. Time is conserved. This is also a good example of the vector property of time. General Relativity shows that in a gravitational field, time is directed opposite the force of gravity. This is illustrated by the bubbles moving up. Other examples of time vectors are candles, where the flame always points up, regardless of the orientation of the wick, trees and other plants which grow up regardless of the tilt of the ground they are on, and the magnetic field of the earth, which is far longer away from the sun than towards it. (like a flame.)

Before I begin discussing philosophical implications of Conservation of time, I must include a brief description of some of the scientific aspects.

As I stated the conservation, it sounds a great deal like Newton's third law, "For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction." Newton's actions and reactions pertain to masses and forces, and since Einstein related mass and time, they are indeed equivalent statements. Newton, then, should be credited with the first Conservation of Time theory.

In the world of common experience, the vast majority of particles encountered are electrically neutral, which means that there are an equal number of negative charges and positive charges. Applying Conservation of Time, this seems to indicate that one charge moves in one direction in time, the other in the opposite direction. With an equal number of each, overall time is conserved. Looking at the structure of the atom, this seems likely enough. The center of mass of an atom is in the nucleus which is positive, and the electron which is heading away from the nucleus is negative. The nucleus is the time source for the atom, and the electron rides an isochrone, at rest in time. To move to a higher energy level, which means moving ahead in time and farther away from the nucleus, the electron needs to receive energy. If it moves back in time, it loses energy. Also, two electrons with opposite spins in the same orbital are going opposite directions in time from each other. This simplifies the Pauli Exclusion Principle to the commonsense phrasing, only one particle is allowed to be at one place at one time. Each electron orbital is only one place, but two times, each opposite the other. This of course conserves time.

Free neutrons decay in just a few minutes to a proton, an electron, and an antineutrino. In a nucleus, neutrons supposedly become stable. I believe that actually the strong nuclear force does not cause the neutron to become stable, but bends, curves, and changes time so that time in the nucleus is either halted or slowed down a great deal.

The philosophical implications are many and varied, and at least as important as the scientific implications. I will try to touch on the more important points.

It seems to me that many philosophers could look through all scientific knowledge known to man, seeing every fact meticulously defined by mathematical equation and proven by careful experiment, and still say when they are done, "Terrific, but it doesn't say anything about human consciousness." I cannot separate myself that completely from the universe. My own existence is no different than that of a tree, or an electron, or a quasar. My body and my mind function due to certain principles which might not be fully understood, but I will not limit my own curiosity by saying that they are unknowable. Even if I can't understand something, or no one alive today can understand something, dare I tell future generations that they needn't bother trying? Certainly not. I believe that in time there is nothing that man cannot know or do, so long as

we never fear the truth.

Human consciousness is moving in time like any other particle, with some interesting special qualities. It can use information gathered earlier in time to change its own state in the present, and its direction into the future. It also loses track of time at more or less regular intervals. People need to sleep and dream.

During our waking hours, our minds are ticking away some measure of time. Without timekeeping devices, we cannot be sure of exactly how much time has passed over a given interval, but we would notice that time had passed. While we are unconscious, we lose our sense of time totally. I know that I certainly can't tell the difference between sleeping for a half hour and sleeping for twenty-four hours. As far as our waking consciousness knows, we stop in time while we sleep.

Then, there are dreams. Dreams certainly exist, and take time, but it is very hard to relate time in a dream to time in real life. There is nothing to use as a standard which is constant to both worlds. They seem to be some sort of opposites of each other. Well, that is how I see it. If we assume we move forward in time while awake, (which seems somewhat arbitrary) then while we dream, we are moving backwards in time. This seems a satisfactory conclusion, being that dreams generally consist of past memories jumbled into a new arrangement. So even in human consciousness, time is conserved. Herein lies our immortality.

Being born is like turning on a lightbulb. Time is being given off by every point of mass. The light from the bulb stays at a constant time, propagating in all directions. A baby who is born rides a similar wave. He (she) is a continuous function of time. At any time after birth, that baby must be somewhere, and can only be at one place.

We take something for granted in our general outlook on the universe. It doesn't affect scientific findings very much, because it doesn't change the ideal cases and fundamental truths that science pursues. However, when talking about the specific case of a single human being, it matters a great deal. To explain I return to the lightbulb analogy. Eventually, one of those photons that's riding on its isochrone hits an atom, and is absorbed. Let's say it moves along with this atom for a little while, then is reemitted, absorbed by a different atom a distance away, reemitted, and so on. Now, nothing is wrong with that photon. It's just as happy being absorbed and reemitted as it was on that isochrone, but because it spent even the smallest amount of time being absorbed and moving in time, it can never again reach that same isochrone again. It will always be at least a little behind it.

What will the other photons think? Well, their buddy was absorbed. Every photon gets absorbed sooner or later, too bad it happened so soon. They mourn for him, and look at the hole in their shell, the shadow of the atom that absorbed him, and think about the inevitable day when they too will be absorbed.

I believe that the situation is exactly analogous to death as we see it in our reality. We may have been born at different times, but we are moving on the same isochronal surface. We are all continuous functions with respect to this particular wave of events that is steadily moving into the future. What would happen if someone were to stop moving for a moment? Well, in the world he was in, he would die. His body would stop working and his friends would be really depressed; However, what is stopping him from moving again in time? What if he was hit by a truck crossing the street? You might say that if it happened that way, that's it—it must always happen that way, but why? Why must there be only one wave of reality, which only passes once? The earth is a huge mass, so it should have a tremendous number of realities waiting to push out through space-time. Remember the point of this paper is the Conservation of Time principle. Take the point about moving backwards in time in dreams literally. If the person who was hit by the truck just takes a reality behind the reality where he is hit by the truck, and looks both ways before he crosses the street, he'll be fine. He'll never know that he was killed, and he'll still be continuous in what is now his reality. The rest of the world will be there, just about as they are in the reality ahead of him, where he died, but which he can never catch up to, because they are both traveling at the speed of time.

So, in conclusion, the universe seems like a pretty nice place to me. Everyone is immortal in their own realities, all the laws of science work out to be part of one Conservation of Time principle, and if I get really bored I can watch shampoo bubbles in the shower.

Seriously, this was an overview of Conservation of Time. I've left out quite a lot of the scientific verifications, and many scientific implications, such as thermodynamics and antimatter. I have included the main philosophical points, as it stands now. I really believe all this stuff. I hope you find it at least amusing.

*Date: 2024-08-10*

# THE ART OF CONTEMPLATION.

THE INDIVIDUAL is an aperture through which the whole energy of the universe is aware of itself, a vortex of vibrations in which it realizes itself as man or beast, flower or star—not alone, but as central to all that surrounds it. These centers are not, as may seem, apart from their surroundings, but stand in mutual relationship to them—center to circumference—in the same way as the magnetic poles. It is thus that each center anywhere implies all other centers elsewhere. The individual is not, therefore, only a center. He is the entire surround centered at this time or this place, which is why the astrologers try to infer the character of an individual from the disposition of the universe encircling him, though it is doubtful whether they know how to read it correctly.

The whole system is symbiotic in principle, for no individual can appear, for however short a time, except in mutual interdependence with the whole. For it could be said, in the rather clumsy language of nouns and verbs which arbitrarily distinguishes things from events, that the individual is something which the whole is doing, and that the whole is something which the individual is doing simultaneously. This relationship is not ordinarily felt or recognized in human consciousness, fascinated as it is by the apparent independence of the individual from the whole—and also frightened by it. The individual feels restricted to the area of his vibrating behavior, since all else seems to be an independent and uncontrollable happening on the part of something quite

It is a false image for three reasons. 

The first is that it is only a concept or symbol, and thus can no more do anything than the word "water" can quench thirst. The second is that it is no more than an impoverished caricature of our whole organism, since there is nothing in it which corresponds to the subconscious processes of our being. The third is that it entirely leaves out the polar unity of the organism with the universe, ignoring the fact that the two are a single process.

Under the impression that this pure abstraction is the vital core and organizing center of our being, we try to exert its "will" when action is difficult or emotions hard to restrain. Thus in "taking a hard look" at something, or listening intently, we tighten muscles in the regions of the eyes and ears. We scratch our heads when we are puzzled, and frown when we are trying to pay close attention. We grit our teeth when trying to endure pain, clench our fists when trying to "hold on to ourselves," and tighten our stomach muscles when attempting to restrain anxiety. All these actions are futile, and do nothing to attain the desired objectives. But they are chronic and habitual, and build up a generalized state of bodily tension, often centered just above and between the eyes, which serves as the referent, the felt experience, corresponding to the symbol-image of the person or ego—thus marrying an illusion to a futility.

The question—what, then, can be done to overcome this false sense of identity and to replace it with polar vision and cosmic consciousness—is impossible to answer in its own terms. All that needs to be experienced for cosmic consciousness is already

# 3

To understand the reciprocity or mutual interdependence of polar opposites—being and nothing, center and surround, self and other, doing and happening—might be called polar vision. I have been speaking of it in the dry terms of logic, in which it may be grasped intellectually. But when polar vision comes in the form of immediate sensation and feeling, it is known as mystical experience or cosmic consciousness, and of this it is better to speak in the mode of poetry and paradox. Thus to feel polar vision is to feel that what happens to you is your own doing, and that your own doing is happening to you; that death and emptiness is the firm ground upon which life walks; and that oneself as both center and surround is the eternal universe. But this feeling, or intuition, does not come in the form of words or ideas, and does not depend on any trick of imagination or self-suggestion. It is more as when one simply sees the sky or feels that one is alive.

This feeling, or, rather, the basis for it, is always present. We are unaware of it only because our consciousness is distracted by another and incompatible feeling of identity which almost all thinking peoples learn from childhood. All too easily, we confuse symbols and signs with what they represent, as in saying, "this is a tree," when that to which we are pointing is quite other than the sound "tree." At a much deeper level we confuse what we actually are, as center-and-surround or organism-and-environment, with an idea, concept, or image of ourselves from which the interdependence of self and other is absent. This image we call the "I," the ego, the person, or the subject (as distinct from the object). We consider it as the doer of our deeds, the thinker of our thoughts, and the feeler of our feelings.

# 2

other than himself. He does not realize that, just as one cannot walk without ground, one cannot experience being except in relation to happening, or self (center) except in relation to other (surround). Thus, nothing other than oneself is quite other, for between self and other, doing and happening, there is, again, the same kind of unity which exists between magnetic poles, or between the crest and the trough of a wave.

The system as a whole appears to be a distribution of solid entities or nodes of energy in the midst of emptiness or space. Human consciousness preoccupies itself with these entities, and virtually ignores their spatial background. We consider it "nothing," in the sense of that which has neither importance nor significance, forgetting that without the spatial field none of these entities could be manifested or distinguished. There is, however, between space and entity the same polar relationship as between crest and trough, for which reason nothingness is not simply the contrary or absence of being but rather its ground and origin. We believe so firmly in the maxim "ex nihilo nihil fit"—if nothing can come out of nothing—that it is almost impossible for us to see that emptiness is the essential prerequisite for every form of being, unless we can conceive that space has some structure concealed from our senses.

While there are indeed such structures or processes as cosmic rays which do not appear to the naked senses, the usefulness and potency of emptiness is, as Lao-tzu said, precisely, that it is perfectly empty. "Being and non-being arise mutually." Thus not to see the unity of self and other is the fear of life, and not to see the unity of being and non-being is the fear of death.

present, and anything in excess of this would be obstructive & redundant—like red ink in a rose. Otherwise, it is simply necessary to see that our usual "I" is a false and impotent image. But just as this phantom cannot actually will or do anything, it cannot get rid of itself. No tensing of muscles or, for that matter, deliberate relaxing of muscles, no repetitions of formulae, no self-suggestion, no exercises of imagination, no psychophysical regimens of any kind will do anything but add strength to the phantom. For every littlest movement to change, or to try not to change, the way you actually feel now will be just one more of those futile muscular tensions (like trying to lift an airliner off the ground by straining at your seat-belt) which give semblance to the reality of the separated ego. You, considered as that ego, cannot get polar vision or cosmic consciousness. It might arise all of itself, as if by divine grace, but there is nothing, just nothing, you can do or not do to bring it about. Yogis and Zen followers sometimes come to this point after long and heroic efforts.

At this point there is nothing to do except what is happening of itself. All that remains is the simple awareness of what is going on—trees outside, street sounds, clock ticking, sunlight on carpet, breathing, body feelings, talking to yourself in your head. Usual cosmic jazz. That's what there is, and every bit of it, including memories and recollections, is happening now. It comes out of nothing as sounds come out of silence, for it should be obvious that the universe has always started from now and left traces behind, like a pen as it writes, though the written record, the seeming past, is still and only now.

You, as ego, cannot change what you are feeling, and you cannot, effectively, try not to change it. There is simply and only what is happening, including those particular thoughts, images, and tensions which you customarily attributed to the phantom thinker and doer. They persist like echoes, but as it is seen that they are just static in the nervous system and not the work of any central ego, they lose interest, subside, and go away of themselves. Hoping that they will go away is just more static.

If you have understood all this, you are simply aware of what is happening now, and we might call this state meditation or, better, contemplation. But it is not that you are something which is just watching what happens. "What happens" is just using your organism to watch itself. It is the universe centering as a particular being, though it is not necessary to use or insist on this concept, for what is important here is not the idea but the feeling of it. The words are only a special use of noises in the air, marks on paper, or vibrations in the brain.

If this becomes clear, the effort to transform one's own mind should collapse, and along with it the whole illusion that one is a separate center of consciousness to which experience happens and for which these happenings are problematic. This collapse would then become the state of contemplation, the realization that all is One. I may understand this point theoretically, but still there seems to be no change, for which reason I look for some process whereby I can move from theoretical to immediate or intuitive understanding—not recognizing that this is still a subtle form of the

absurd attempt to transform the transformer, arising from the illusory distinction of thinker and thought, experiencer and experience.

So long as this subtle confusion remains, one can be beguiled into various ways of trying to meditate, and a competent guru will suggest techniques so clever that their absurdity will be difficult to discover without resolute attempts to follow them through. Furthermore, the aspirations and minor successes of other seekers will compound a collective illusion, and even a mutual one-upmanship contest, of believing that this or that method or guru is, at last, the one that really works. Yet the intention of the guru himself is simply to exhaust the energy of the illusion by bringing his disciples again and again to experiences of the absurdity of trying to transform mind with mind. As the Zen patriarch Seng-ts'an put it:

The wise person does not strive;  
The ignorant man ties himself up...  
If you work on your mind with your mind,  
How can you avoid an immense confusion?

But once it has been explained, you may naturally ask whether it is really necessary to go through all this rigorous folly to dissipate the illusion. You will wonder whether knowing, theoretically, in advance that these disciplines are absurd, you will no longer have the motivation to follow them through. Yet shouldn’t it be clear that the very question "Is it necessary in order to dissipate?" arises directly from the illusion itself? If it isn’t clear, you will have the itch to go through the discipline, and try to "get some attainment and rise to some higher rank of spiritual superiority." But if it is clear,

you may feel completely non-plussed and confounded, as if—as they say in Zen—you were a mosquito trying to bite an iron bull. However, this feeling is precisely the sensation that there is no separate self which can either do or not do anything about the problem. Thus it may appear, further, that if there is no distinct ego to be non-plussed, the stream of experience can simply flow on unobstructedly by itself. Hence the verse:

Blue mountains are of themselves blue mountains;  
White clouds are of themselves white clouds.

This unobstructed flow is the Tao, the way or course of nature, and is also what is meant by the state of non-attachment—a spontaneous, unforced, and unblocked flowing of life. Yet the prospect of such flowing as a way of life gives us intense moral anxiety, for at once there are qualms about unleashing the tigers and demons within us if no control is exercised. But such qualms are, again, symptoms of the same old illusion. What if there has been no controlling self all along? Consider, too, whether the human condition could be much more depraved than it is already, and mark the horrendous behavior of people who believe in will-power and in control over their minds and their circumstances. 

Hitler was an ascetic; Rasputin had incredible mastery of his mind and body; and many of the samurai exploited Zen training for the improvement of military skills, though there were a few, like Miyamoto Musashi, who finally realized the futility of the enterprise. The Tao flows without obstruction whether we know it or not, for the not knowing is no more than a variant pattern of the

flow. As another Zen verse puts it:

If you understand, things are just as they are;  
If you do not understand, things are just as they are.

Now it is widely believed that those who are free from the illusion of separateness are automatically endowed with extraordinary powers, and this is true in the obvious sense that all the wonders of nature are no other than oneself. Beyond this, the gifts of psionic powers (siddhi) may or may not be manifested, just as there may or may not be good weather. In any milieu where the liberated guru is highly revered, people will faith-heal themselves of sickness in his presence, and attribute the cure to his magic. But meditation may be regarded as a state in which the fruits of nature and the potentialities of the human organism may develop more richly, though this will never happen if their growth is forced. So long, then, as we are concerned with powers, we are still aiming at increased control of nature and aggravating our frustrations. I am speaking, needless to say, of a control of nature supposedly imposed from the outside. It is really incorrect to think of nature as controlled, self-controlled, or uncontrolled, for the idea of control always involves a duality in which one element commands and the other obeys, or refuses to obey. The pattern or order of nature depends on no such division, since cause and effect, action and reaction, are simply two aspects or poles of a single process, or two ways of looking at it. No cause is separate from its effect, except for purposes of description in dualistic language.

# 10

As a rule, the mystics and gurus who are no longer seeking any attainment go on with what appears to be the formal practices of meditation. The various Buddhas and Bodhisattvas are usually depicted in the position of meditating in the padmasana or lotus-posture like any novice, but this is actually a ritual which is done for its own sake—as one might play the flute, or dance, or invite friends to a formal dinner. It is almost ridiculous to ask, "Why meditate?" as if it were going out of one’s way to do something bizarre, like lying on a bed of nails. Why look at the stars or watch clouds? Why go sailing to no fixed destination? Nothing is really explained by its cause or motivation, for we find only causes behind causes until we can pursue them no longer. It is like a child asking "Why? Why? Why?... " until its father, like a Zen master, says, "O shut up and suck your lollipop!"

Thus contemplation as a particular "exercise," done in a formal way, is simply the ritual enjoyment of that basic awareness of what is happening now which goes on always from moment to moment. In the same way, dancing as dancing is the ritual form of dancing while cooking, or dancing with the pen while writing. It is therefore quite against the spirit of such contemplation to undertake it in a mood of grim seriousness as is sometimes the way in monasteries and religious communities which are really schools for adolescents without true vocation to the contemplative life, where young people are drilled in ritual like conscripted soldiers. Children must under no circumstances 

# 11

be forced to participate in such exercises, just as we would not dream of requiring them to engage in sexual intercourse. In such ritual it is equally absurd to treat ourselves as children, and to browbeat ourselves into arduous practice with the thought that it will be good for us. The goal of contemplation is contemplation—not some future result that it may bring.

While there are traditional forms of the contemplative ritual, there are no fixed ways in which it must be done. It has, however, been found appropriate to sit like a Buddha with the legs crossed, or in lotus-posture, with the back easily erect and the breath coming and going on its own as if it were falling out and falling in, not as being pushed out or pulled in.

In the same spirit, one does not listen but simply hears all sounds that are emerging from silence without making any effort to place or identify them. Similarly, one does not look, but only sees light, color, and form playing with the eyes as they, too, emerge moment by moment from the void. Thoughts, likewise, are treated in the same way as sounds, and, if they arise, are merely watched without comment as they come and go, "hearing" them in the same way as one would hear the chattering of birds on the roof.

When the breath subsides into a slow rhythm, it is a special delight to let the voice float a tone upon it, with the sound OM, or the mantra OM AH HUM, and to hear the tone reverberating—perhaps to the accompaniment of a gong which is allowed to hum until its sound fades into all other

# 12

sounds. There are many suitable forms of such chanting ritual, employing not only prolonged single tones, but also rhythmic phrases repeated again and again, as for instance the familiar lilting mantra HARI KRISHNA, HARI KRISHNA, KRISHNA KRISHNA, HARI HARI; HARI RAMA, HARI RAMA, RAMA RAMA, HARI HARI. What is important here is not the meaning of the words but their actual sound and the movement of the breath and lips, giving direct experience of the basic energy of life as it comes from the void.

It is possible that in the course of contemplation there may arise visions or ecstatic states of consciousness, and it is a natural temptation to think of these as the goals of contemplation. However, to attempt to prolong these states, or to regain them when they subside, is like straining the facial muscles to see clearly, and is an effort to interrupt the natural flow of what is happening now. There may also arise a curious sensitivity to the unspoken thoughts and intentions of others, or astonishing dexterity of intellect or fidelity of memory, but these are not to be taken as signs of "progress" in contemplation, because contemplation ceases as soon as there is any seeking for results. Such temptations as these beset ritual contemplation in the same way as playing a musical instrument may be used for ends extraneous to the enjoyment of music, as in competing with oneself or with others for musical status.

Too much concern for ritual contemplation may also lead to a one-sidedly passive form of life and to the impression of

falling away from the eternal now while engaged in other and more strenuous activities. Now the habitual use of muscular tension as the referent for the ego in looking, listening, and willing carries over into the use of natural physical exertion in running, lifting, and hauling so as to make such actions seem entirely different from those which happen "of themselves," spontaneously. Curiously, this sets up, say, in the effort to run, a redundant effort to make the effort, giving the impression that the exertion of running is a direct demonstration of the activity and potency of the ego-image. We have learned, mostly as children, to put on an act of strenuousness while doing strenuous things. Yet efforts to make efforts, being redundant, work against the natural use of muscular energy in such a way that they are self-imposed obstacles, or efforts against effort. It is as if, in pulling, the triceps were to work against the biceps. When this redundant use of effort falls away, it becomes obvious that decisions to do this or that, and the consequent physical actions, happen of themselves like everything else.

For free action is certainly not caused by a purely abstract "I." It emerges from the total intelligence of the organism, in the same way as the growth of the brain and the digestion of food, and it will employ conscious reasoning in situations where reasoning is an appropriate tool. This would perhaps be called biologically or physically "determined" action by those who separate the organism from the rest of the universe, and see it "obeying" or "responding" to "drives" which have first been defined as external to itself.

# 14

But the individual-and-universe has no external or extraneous determinant. The individual may be seen as constrained by natural processes only when viewed out of context as something in but not of its whole environment. Laws and artificial restraints become necessary when, through the illusion of separateness, the individual loses touch with his organic intelligence and feels at odds with his environment. Obviously, the operation of organic intelligence is not to be confused with the false spontaneity of actions deliberately calculated to be at variance with natural order or human law. Social conventions still govern those who go out of their way to oppose them.

In past times all matters concerning the practice of contemplation were considered esoteric or, what amounts in the West to the same thing, heretical—though not every heresy was of this order, and the contemplative way became heresy only as people tried to describe its content. For, speaking in religious language, it would be plain to the contemplative that only God exists, and that there is nothing other than God. For obvious reasons this is a doctrine greatly feared by both ecclesiastical and secular rulers. On the one hand, when it is necessary that the people be exploited and oppressed, it is important to imbue them with a servile mentality. On the other hand, when people are vulgar and greedy, the mere idea that "all is God" or that good and evil are polar is used to justify every wanton excess. It is for this reason that governments forbid the ingestion of hemp flowers and other psychedelic substances, lest immature and half-civilized individuals profane the mysteries. One does not wish noble wines to be used for drunken brawls.

The fiction of the isolated ego or person as the real individual has therefore been implanted to stimulate the feeling of creatureliness and the fear of God. It is likewise advantageous to rulers that the people be blind to the polarity of life and death, and so fear death if they fear not God. But when those who implant this fiction are also its dupes, they seek for themselves as persons the powers which they already enjoy as God, but have forgotten. In this endeavor they resort to such crude wisdom as may be expressed in linear signs, words, and numbers for the government of a non-linear and immeasurably subtle world. And as the person is a linear version of man, confused with the real man, so the linear understanding of the world—with which linear wisdom must deal—is confused with the real world. Only by violence, then, can the real and living world be straightened out, squared away, evened off, boxed into clear-cut categories, and so conformed to the crudities of linear wisdom. Consequently, all the balances and interdependencies of nature are thrown into confusion—to the bewilderment of birds, beasts, and plants, and the befuddlement of man's own non-linear body and brain. In such an emergency it is necessary to take the risks of exposing the illusion of the person and all its works, and to allow what has been esoteric to become generally known.

It is thus that, in contemplation, man discovers himself as inseparable from the cosmos as a whole in both its positive and negative aspects, its appearances and disappearances. Astronomy and physics are therefore theoretical adumbrations of the vastness of our dimensions,

for it is not simply that we are subordinate parts of the system, but that the entire system is oneself in its full and only true sense. Ordinarily, we may glimpse this truth in a shallowly intellectual way, and consider it as a lofty idea that has little relation to practical affairs and basic emotions. But in contemplation this view is as real and self-evident as breathing, and enables the problems of mundane life to be seen in their true perspective—sub specie aeternitatis—balancing and correcting the usual myopia of exclusive preoccupation with nasty little games and schemes.

Nature, that is, our own true nature, is bringing these preoccupations to a stop by coming forth with the technical power to pursue them on a colossal scale, hitherto unknown. Pursued and magnified with such power, they come swiftly to absurdity and catastrophe—so that their innate contradictions become obvious to all. For we have been trying to harness technology to the impossible game of having positive without negative, defying the principles of that very electricity upon which technology so largely depends. This objective is as illusory as the ego which seeks it.

Thus a time when the objective seems clearly unattainable is a time ripe for the unmasking of that ego—itself the persona-mask which conceals the splendor of our Original Face. When spring comes the buds break out of their husks, the little birds cast off their shells, and young plants burst from their seed-casings.... When there is a crack in the Cosmic Egg, Buddha is about to be born.

## Entry 198: Mindful Word Choice Importance
*Date: 2024-08-18*

```plaintext
We chose our words in the presence of others, whether we are aware of this or not.

Nothing bothers me more about people than their callousness towards others, in the choice of their words. I don’t care how they talk to me, or at least I like to think that any words they say to me won’t bother me, and that I’ll be able to figure out what they’re trying to say in my own terms by my knowledge of them or give them the benefit of the doubt if I don’t know. What bothers me is when I see heated arguments with flares of hate due to people being lazy in their choice of words. How many people have died due to lack of communication and misinterpretation?
```

**Summary**: 
The text reflects on the importance of being mindful with word choice, particularly in the presence of others. The writer expresses frustration with people's insensitivity in their language towards others, noting that misunderstandings and conflicts often arise from careless or lazy word choices. The reflection highlights the potential consequences of such communication failures, including serious conflicts and even death.

## Entry 202: Personal Reflections and Neuroscience
*Date: 2024-08-25*

**Summary**:  
The final part of the essay continues the exploration of the Conservation of Time principle, using the metaphor of photons to explain how time affects individual entities, like humans, in a personal context. The author draws an analogy between the absorption of photons and death, suggesting that just as photons cannot return to their original state, humans also move forward in time and experience similar irreversible changes. The essay also touches on the possibility of multiple realities and concludes with the idea that the universe is a "nice place," where everyone is immortal within their own reality, governed by the same scientific laws. The author closes with a reflection on the philosophical nature of the essay, noting its omission of some scientific details but affirming the importance of the ideas discussed.

**Image Descriptions**:  
- *Image 9*: Page eight of the essay, discussing the analogy between photons and human existence, the inevitability of change, and the possibility of multiple realities.
- *Image 10*: Page nine, concluding the essay with reflections on the universe, immortality, and the Conservation of Time principle, along with a handwritten note in the margin that reads, "Notably amusing but rather poetic!"

## Entry 203: Ontology of Identity
*Date: 2024-08-26*

```plaintext
The Absolute of Being is You. Every moment You are Being in a two-Fold relation with each Moment.

You = {What you think of the world / What you think of yourself}

You which is, who you think you are in the moment, is how the world is understood by written language consciousness.

For most people, as we relate to other people, we make a model of who we think they are and update it with each subsequent conversation.

Implicitly, in the experience of each moment, we are also conscious of who I am in relation to the other person engaged in discourse. In this way conversation creates identity sentence by sentence.

True meaning, ontological meaning, exists in what you call the sentence, and in the reading of any sentence or token.

Ontological experience  
The Ontologized Linguistic Unit  
The Experient

A Neural Network / Hilbert Space of Identity = {What I think the world is / What I think I am in that world}

Posture for next Experient -> the Cardinal change

“Time” in itself allows World observation

You are Being.  
You are a Human Being.  
You know yourself as a person.

As a Being, you share essential structures of all Beings.

A Being is Ontologized Because interaction with a corporeal Field of Being.

A Human Being is one of a large planetary biome, creatures, which evolved into Your body.

You are a person, which is a Mask of words, which people believe is what other people think is who a person is. In understanding other people in terms of sentences, we also identify an internal identity. In so doing, we hide from the world behind the mask of who we wish we were.
```

**Summary of Content:**
The notes explore the concept of being and identity, emphasizing the dual relationship between one's perception of the world and self-perception. It discusses how identity is constructed through language and interaction, particularly in conversations where we form and adjust our understanding of others and ourselves. The text also touches on the nature of meaning and the role of time in observation and identity formation. The idea of being is considered both in a universal sense and as a human experience shaped by language, interactions, and the biological evolution of the body.

**Image Descriptions:**
1. The first image contains text discussing the relationship between personal identity and perception of the world, emphasizing the role of language in shaping consciousness.
2. The second image expands on the concept of ontological meaning and identity, introducing ideas like neural networks and Hilbert space in the context of being and experiencing.
3. The third image continues to explore the nature of being, human identity, and the distinction between one's true self and the mask created by social interactions and language.

It is the

Couples Path of Solution

A Couples Guide  
To a Path of Solution  
By allowing each person  
To Be themselves.

As if they were simply Human.

We are the subject  
in every word  
Everything we’ve heard  
Every noun and verb

We are the subject  
And everything clear  
Lets us disappear  
Behind the stand

We are the subject  
Taking our lives  
And say it word by word  
Looking back on our world  
The one we know  
and the one our senses show.

Did I lose my other notebook binder? I hope not, but I’ll find out when I get back to my car... which I have to do before we play. I’m at “Hungry Ghost” and Shyam is here working on songs, snippets from the Ramayana.

So I can write.

Funny. I feel funny... peculiar but not a lot. A feeling of stepping back from life. A continuation of last week’s cheery Sunday. It’s Friday again—but maybe I have to work Sunday this week. Ugh.

Who are we thinking that our scales of Time and Space have real relevance?

I need to make more money, and maybe putting my thoughts down into a blog and out into the virtual universe can help make that happen. But that’s not what I want to write about now...

Christmas Day, I got a Christmas Pen. And this is me writing with it.

Now it’s Saturday after Christmas, and I’ve gone through and written on already written pages. In this way I realize I could write longer words with each page grow, only when I have the best specific thing to write.
```

**Summary of Content:**
These entries are personal reflections on various topics. The writer begins by worrying about a lost notebook, then describes a peculiar feeling of detachment from life, possibly related to work obligations. They question the relevance of human perceptions of time and space, and consider blogging as a way to make more money. The second entry notes receiving a pen as a Christmas gift and reflects on writing practices, including revisiting and expanding upon previously written pages.

**Image Descriptions:**
1. The first image contains musings on a lost notebook, feelings of detachment, and thoughts on the relevance of time and space.
2. The second image features notes about receiving a Christmas pen and thoughts on writing, particularly about expanding on existing content.

## Entry 206: Ontology of Identity
*Date: 2024-08-26*

```plaintext
Beings are time travelers. In fact, they move only in time, in an absolute way. Movement in space is relative.

Light moves only in space, not in time.

Human Beings are beings. We absorb and emit light (as electromagnetic energy).

We move light through time, and light moves us through space.

So, let’s see.

If I were to put it all together, I would want to write about, as always, how the world works.

Be specific. For myself, I want to understand, between my senses and memory what will happen in the future based on what I am seeing now, and what I remember from the past. Who I am is what I know about my path from my memory horizon, and I know about now through my senses. It is my actions that move me into the future. The principle action is time itself, which is that possibility of change, which is Now.

The objectiveness of the outside world is an assumption which is not founded in observation, because all observations are necessarily subjective.

A human being is a biological being which is propelled through a timeline of sensations, actions, and reactions, all of which plays out between corporeal substance from our bodies out into every corner of our imagination.

For us to be asking questions, finding answers and writing them down, it means that we live in a world of language and we mentally spend most of our waking hours and even many movements of our minds into words, then allowing words to evoke movements in our mind which strike us with every emotion we are capable of.

While the benefits of language, and specifically the written languages which have conquered the entire species, are diverse and fundamental to our way of life, it is crucial that we step back and for a moment question what we may have lost by growing so dependent on the modes of thinking demanded by written language consciousness.

What is required for a calculus of consciousness? A model of a Being in a Subjective Field of Being.

Definitions—
Being Energy = Being as a Verb = Be

The amount of Energy embodied in the fundamental cycle of each Being.

Being Mass = Being as a Noun = Bm

The Returned Energy that is not dissipated in the fundamental cycle of each being.

The rate of time is relative to the local time field = gravity field.
The fact of time (consciousness) is an attribute of Being.
```

**Summary of Content:**
These pages explore philosophical concepts related to time, light, and human existence. The writer discusses the idea that beings are time travelers, moving only through time, while light moves through space. They reflect on how human beings interact with light and time, suggesting that our actions move us into the future. The writer also delves into the nature of objectivity and subjectivity, emphasizing that all observations are subjective. There is a discussion about the role of language and how it shapes human experience, alongside considerations of what might be lost due to our dependence on written language. Finally, the text introduces a framework for understanding consciousness through a model of "Being," involving concepts of energy, mass, and time.

**Image Descriptions:**
1. The first image discusses the relationship between beings, time, and light.
2. The second image reflects on how the writer would synthesize their thoughts on how the world works, focusing on time, memory, and subjectivity.
3. The third image expands on the concept of human beings as biological entities, emphasizing the role of language and imagination.
4. The fourth image introduces definitions for "Being" in terms of energy and mass, proposing a framework for understanding consciousness.

## Entry 207: Ontology of Identity
*Date: 2024-08-26*

```plaintext
My impulse to write has always been a drive to record an important idea that I feel at that moment other people should know. I allow myself to strive for thoughts that explain to me how the world works. I feel compelled to find words I can put on paper that will help others who may be striving to understand the world.

But I step back and consider if whatever I may have thought of, I had read words describing it first, then I would not have had the chance to learn it on my own, and so the words that I read describing the same thing could never really mean the same thing as the thought which I chose them to convey. A paradox.

Ontological Investigations

Ontology is the study of Being itself. The field of study designated as the field of ontology is lived experience. One can speak abstractly about other people’s experience of Being, and use language to make broad generalizations about groups of people and their ontological experiences and opinions. The approach used here is to focus on the being of me, the writer of this text, and the reader, you.

There is something very important about you reading this, relative to how to specify as exactly as possible which Being we are talking about. The writer and the reader create an ontological partnership for the duration of the text. For the writer, they are considering perhaps one, perhaps a few people who will read their words.

Reality is subjective!  
Only Beings are subjects.  
The world as a whole is an inter-subjective world.  
The Objective world is a fiction believed by people.
```

**Summary of Content:**
These entries delve into the writer's motivation for writing and the philosophical study of ontology. The first part reflects on the impulse to record important ideas and the paradox that arises when trying to communicate thoughts that others have already articulated. The second part introduces the concept of "Ontological Investigations," focusing on the study of Being as a lived experience, particularly the relationship between the writer and the reader. Finally, the text concludes with brief statements on the nature of reality, asserting that reality is subjective, and that the objective world is a collective fiction.

**Image Descriptions:**
1. The first image discusses the writer's motivation for writing and the paradox of conveying thoughts through language that may have already been expressed by others.
2. The second image introduces "Ontological Investigations," focusing on the study of Being and the relationship between writer and reader.
3. The third image presents concise statements on the nature of reality, emphasizing subjectivity and the fictional nature of the objective world.

June 17 2019  
21,522 Days old

I just had a CAT Scan in preparation for my sinus surgery, to remove nasal polyps. I’m in the waiting room, waiting to get the CD with the scan data on it. 

Yesterday was Father’s day. Hilary and I went down to see my parents. Hung out in the backyard with our dogs, ate vegetarian Chinese food and hung out.

Filling up time. A universe of moments. We all have the same number of moments, just seen from each of our unique perspectives.

Now that I’m writing, I realize I haven’t been writing much. So much to say, but who am I talking to? Setting perspective, my current moment, informing a nebulous future.

I so want to understand physics. I want to be able to put how I feel into perspective with what I am.

My head is vibrating just a little, I imagine. It’s never exactly from the X-rays, but what does that mean?

Wanderlust 2019 - Sunday Night

Waiting.  
Only one form of enhancement. No drinking, of course. And to preserve my sense of smell, no smoking... or edibles. Or whatever.

I feel enormously appreciated... for drumming, for doing Sanctuary, for conversations, for playing music. But... I wish Hilary were here and... well... I was going to say I wished she appreciated the Burn experience, but I’m not sure that’s really what I mean. Because I don’t disagree with her reasoning.

I was different when I started doing burns, and I was looking for a community that liked the things I liked, and I was very tolerant of other aspects of the community, in order to find an interest within an interesting community. Now, being here avoiding so many of the bonding rituals around substances, I do feel a distance. A... why am I here feeling.

Tired of waiting took my 2 gbs. That should do it. It’ll do something anyway.

Watching Dr. Who while Hilary is working on the web site.

And I’m thinking—about things.

For the site, I want to create other ways to support the studio and the community project.

And I’ve been mulling QBism, primes, and a new “Bullseye” probability game, that takes as input a tuple of numbers between -1 and 1, which, if the numbers are truly random, approach e.

An app. What would the prime number explorer + Bullseye game + QBism probabilities look like?

Phenomenology of the Meaning of Books

All Books are Read in a Context

We spend our lives reading a book we call "My Life," with each moment passing through in addition to what happens we are probably going to understand today in the context of all the sentences we've heard, said, or seen somewhere that adds to what I know about where I am in this book I call "My Life."

Language doesn’t necessarily force anyone to believe that the words we have heard before help us define our identity and the foundation of what is possible.

But written language, specifically language which enters the literate words changes which turns the Being, the flow of time itself into the experience of living one single moment, the experience of Living as it is lived.

Without written language, language is always resonance with another Being. The context of all spoken gestures or any action in the moment, what both beings take away is the shared moment with another being.

Writing separates the words from the moment and anchors the meaning to something remote from the moment. The word has a meaning, even without being used.

In this way, the internal narration is born, and our thoughts are now a way of sense impressions, memories of sequences of events which follow, as if we are always singing, dancing, and teaching and learning from others we live with.

We still sing and dance, perhaps, but the creation of a social identity built on institutions of books requires us to understand ourself and the world in sentences. In so doing, we demote the value of everything we may do which cannot be conveyed in sentences.

There is only so much time in a day. It takes about seven seconds to think a sentence. You may be saying the sentence, you may be hearing someone talk, you may be reading an article. You may be taking a shower and thinking about where you left the soap. Only so many sentences.

10,000 sentences is a practical high end of how many sentences you can notice in a day. There are plenty of activities that don’t require sentence thinking. But even when alone, I notice narratives and even dialogues bubble out of my mind. Perhaps there’s something I want to say to a particular person, and when I form the sentence, it occurs to me what they may think of it.

This is a kind of budget. It’s related to the limits of time, but seeing this as a real limit on my own attention.
```

**Summary of Content:**
These pages explore the concept of how we interpret and live our lives as if reading a book titled "My Life." The text delves into the role of language, especially written language, in shaping our experience of time and identity. It contrasts the immediacy of spoken language, which resonates with other beings, with the more abstract, detached nature of written language, which anchors meaning beyond the moment. The writing also reflects on how modern life, with its reliance on sentences and narratives, limits our attention and shapes our social identity. The notion of a "sentence budget" is introduced, highlighting the finite number of sentences one can process in a day, thereby underscoring the constraints on human attention and cognition.

**Image Descriptions:**
1. The first image introduces the concept of the phenomenology of books and the idea that all books are read in a context.
2. The second image expands on the metaphor of life as a book and discusses the role of language in shaping identity and experience.
3. The third image continues the discussion, focusing on the difference between written and spoken language and the creation of social identity through books.
4. The fourth image introduces the idea of a "sentence budget," emphasizing the limits of attention and the constraints of processing sentences throughout the day.

Phenomenology means the study of the most general thing possible, which is the most foundational possible area of study. It is the focus and attention on the flow of conscious phenomena. It is only through our senses and our inner sense of Being that we can know anything that we can understand of the corporeal world and our corporeal body. Phenomenology offers and emphasizes first, and a perspective on finding appropriate and precise methodologies.
```

**Summary of Content:**
This passage defines phenomenology as the study of the most fundamental aspects of experience, emphasizing its role as a foundational area of inquiry. It discusses the focus on the flow of conscious phenomena, stressing that our understanding of the world and our bodies comes through our senses and inner sense of being. The text also highlights the importance of phenomenology in guiding the development of precise methodologies for study and understanding.

8 replies   177 lines   18-DEC-1986 23:11:14

This is a private conference. It was inspired by conversation 
with Tem in Semi. We’ve decided to invite 
some people in the cabin for a semi- 
fictional chat about the people in the cabin. The 
subject is NOON generally, in a detail that is Heidegger 
would say uncanny. 

There is really no inappropriate topic in Tem’s cabin, though 
Tem insists a certain amount of reasonable discretion 
on traditional standards. Medium sized NOON 
is advised, that is, it does not appreciate 
harsh language, except in obvious absurd places. So please exercise 
discreet decorum in this private, secluded place.

In short, welcome.

Tem Noon and Ed Bernstein (Co-moderators and housekeepers)

**Summary:**
This text is part of a semi-fictional, private conversation happening in a digital cabin space moderated by Tem Noon and Ed Bernstein. They discuss inviting people into the cabin for discussions, with some references to philosophical ideas (like Heidegger's concept of "uncanny"). The moderators emphasize the need for discretion, even in this light-hearted and somewhat abstract exchange, while also keeping a friendly and inclusive tone, mentioning virtual tea and new arrivals.

I'm Tem, I live here. I'm from a planet called South Zaxor, 
though I've been flitting around the universe a bit. South Zaxor 
is in another rather small galaxy. In that galaxy I've also spent 
some time on Lamen, Pockhon, Sarb, and the wonderful world of Maec 
before finding my way to Earth.
   On South Zaxor, I became the 256th Recklesh, which is an honor 
as well as a serious responsibility. It has to do with the Barneygrape

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
I didn't start out interested in Philosophy, I remember being 
driven into it in more intense degrees as I wanted other things. 
It seemed like wherever I turned, the same philosophical questions 
kept smacking me in the face. Further, I was writing these notebooks 
(some excerpts in 8.0) that seemed really important, but disjoint. 
I remember telling a philosophy professor that my central goal in 
doing graduate philosophy was to figure out what my notebooks were 
saying.
   That's probably why I still haven't finished my thesis. That 
was an aside from my main study.
   For me, Philosophy is the study of/obsession towards/love of 
first questions. In any field, there are some set of premises which 
separate that field from others, and which define the possible results 
and ideals of the field. This is the "Philosophy of ..."
   According to Husserl and Hegel (each in their own way) the starting 
point for philosophy in general, and therefore all other fields, 
is phenomenology. Husserl called it "The Science of Sciences", but 
that's another note, I suppose.

That's a good point, Simon...and maybe that's the problem I'm 
having with the academically accepted definition of Existentialism. 
It feels more like something done by a philosophy department, than 
by any philosopher in particular. I am more interested in origination 
and applications of philosophy than breaking philosophy into 
categories.

   I like that!! So true. Philosophy sorts out all the confusion 
in the our day to day, minute to minute interaction with the world. 
People need to understand the "philosophy" of their own experience of 
the world. That means an integration of all the different environments 
and attitudes that our civilization demands that we move through. 
Without active thought, it is too easy to become fragmented and 
disconnected from reality.

 .13> BTW, how is philosophy viewed in your universe, Tem Noon? What does 
      it mean to you?
   Hmmm...tricky question, now that I think about it. In general, 
I'd say those most in need of some philosophical contemplation are 
those least likely to take the time and energy to do it, and those 
who think about it the most are the least likely to do anything 
practical with it...but maybe that's not so different from Earth, 
is it?
   There are many philosophical, religious, and ethical systems 
around and about the galaxy, but these can be divided into two basic 
philosophical schools which are practically opposites of each other. 
Most people who understand one well can't make heads or tails of the 
other, which makes it difficult to compare the two objectively. I won't 
bother trying to do the impossible. You may surmise which side I 
fall on.
   There is the Lamish school, and the Maec school.
   Lamen is the largest inhabited planet close to the center of the 
galaxy. Known mostly for the city of the same name which occupies half 
of the second largest continent, it is the financial and trading center 
of the galaxy, as well as the traditional central hub of communications 
and entertainment for the galaxy. On Lamen, everything of consequence is 
referenced and accessed, if it is not defined, cannot be cross 
referenced and accessed, it cannot be true. Experience is never enough. 
Events have been cataloged for as long as anyone can remember on Lamen, 
and therefore any events which might have happened before events were 
cataloged is an absurd idea. It cannot be true, because Lamen Truth is 
only exactly what has been recorded, entered into the great public record as 
Truth. To argue against such a thing, one had best have a long string 
of sources, well cross referenced. 
   On Maec, it's different. The philosophy of Maec, as taught by Qaec, is based 
on the sanctity of every moment of every being. Maec is a word for 
'text', which is literally the fabric of the universe itself. Each 
being, whether a molecule, a star, a luk-luk bird, or a person, 
is writing, and reading this text of the universe...and each moment 
is recorded not just in some localised 'book', but at every point 
in the universe. The text is alive at every being's point with the 
entire tome (so to speak ;-) of the universe, as seen from that 
necessary and sacred perspective. As events happen, they propagate 
outward, riding waves of time, intersecting other waves of time, 
carrying other event records, which are juxtaposed in the perspectives 
of yet other beings who also add their wills to the cosmic cacophony 
of life.
   I hope that gives some flavor of the culturally dependent parts 
of my philosophical background. I'm afraid it might not add much 
to the questions, 'What is Philosophy'. To the question, a Lamish 
philosopher might answer, "The discovery of the old in the new." 
while a modern Maec philosopher might answer, "The dreaming of new 
in the face of the old".

**Summary:**
This sequence of notes explores philosophical musings and introduces characters like Tem Noon and Ed Bernstein from fictional settings like "South Zaxor." The discussions revolve around identity, cosmology, and contrasting philosophical traditions between the "Lamish" and "Maec" schools. The tone is light yet thoughtful, with characters reflecting on the nature of truth, experience, and being. Ed’s interest in philosophy leads to pondering ideas from Hegel and Husserl, while Tem Noon describes a more cosmic, intergalactic

I think I’m on to something.

Written language consciousness derived systems work top-down. There’s control centrally to agents in the wider field.

In nature systems tend to be bottom up. The control is mediated at the peripheries. Communicative networks delay this into activity similar to central control.

Written language systems can coop most conscious minds trapped in written language belief syndrome – but some can see their way through to a single alternative only visible by stepping out of the written language assumptions.

The primary gift of our intelligence is to understand the emotional coordinates of other beings.

Intelligence also has the ability to dismiss this very connection and commonality.

That is the primary crisis of our era, the failure of the intellectual postulates to keep an intellectual model of existence consistent or complete.

Writing results from a few things coming together, and intention and opportunity meet somewhere outside of my mind.

Where is my mind? If it isn’t in space at all, it is in a different space than the space my body is in.

If space is a universe that contains my body, then Time is a universe that contains my mind.

.Tem’s Book  

DAY:  
Overview or point

We Humans can Change Everything Peacefully  
No privacy – Everyone has the right to see everything anyone ever does  
Humans became bored with fire  
Humans cheated and so forgot they were human and thought themselves people.

We must now forgive our ancestors, our parents, and ourselves  
And remember we are all human.

By not permitting ourselves to hide what we are ashamed of, we can start to forgive ourselves, and everyone else.

We suffer our own privacy from when we learn we have anything to be ashamed of.
```

**Summary of the Transcription:**
These pages reflect philosophical musings, contemplations on human nature, and observations about intelligence, communication, and emotional understanding. There’s a consistent theme of considering large concepts (like privacy, time, and space) through the lens of both individual human experience and broader systems—whether they be language systems, societal constructs, or natural patterns.

Ontology of Consciousness

An acknowledgement of the primacy of consciousness in the experience of Being, called Ontology.

To be ontic means it is a moment of experienced existence. To be existential is to experience existence in a lived moment.

To study ontology is a strange phrase to decode because the essence of ontology is that it can also be used.

---

The Standard Model solves the question of "how do we know what the world is made of and based on what we’ve seen, what will it do next?"

In the normal day-to-day experience of most people, all of our senses are made of and interacting with atoms, mirrors of molecules, crystals, and other structures mostly controlled by what the standard model calls electrons. 
The electrons are grouped around nuclei, while the paired quantum and controlling nuclear forces in the standard temperatures and pressures of solids, liquids, and gases encountered by people nearly every day, interact mostly with magnetic tent on an electro-magnetic level, with other electrons.

The language that physics uses to describe electrons is that of electrodynamics of wave operators in a Hilbert Space.

---

The Ontology of Experience is organized around Beings with 3 characteristics.

A Being experiences Consciousness as a moment of corporeal entanglement and noticed correlations between a memory, an expectation, and an action.

Corporeal entanglement happens in the fuzzy boundary of each Being.

---

A Being is an experienced perspective on a Field of Being.

Two or more distinct beings may bond in coherent resonance, such that outside a fuzzy boundary they act as a single Being.

A Being has a memory of at least its immediately previous moment, and possibly many previous moments.

A Being may have an expectation of the next moment, and prepare its understanding of its senses based on expectations linked to memories of similar (resonant) situations.

Being implies a moment of Being. To exist as One Being is to sense the presence at that moment of all that is now, and all that can ever be.

Being a moment is to create the conditions necessary for change. This necessary condition is often and commonly called "time."

But what we refer to as “Time” is not sufficient for the experience of change. Time, as a reference to the abstraction of a system of questions predicting the behavior of a thermodynamic system, as physics endeavors to do, is not how life as conscious beings experience the flow of life around us. 

Consciousness, not as the concept but as the actual nameless initiation of ontological existence, is the same phenomenon as time, as being witnessed from two different perspectives, the observation of the same event with distinct measurements. In the same way a particle or a wave, a moment may be referred to as an instant of time, or as a conscious experience. Time is not something consciousness has access to except through an inner initiation of one more moment of awareness through a moment of Being as Verb.

Being is Time Consciousness through which we know the world. Now, in memory, and imagination.
```

**Summary of the Transcription:**
These notes delve deeply into ontology, exploring how beings experience consciousness, time, and existence. They contrast scientific models like the Standard Model of Physics with philosophical ideas of time and being, asserting that our conscious experience of time is more nuanced and less rigid than scientific abstractions suggest. The concept of "Being" is analyzed as an experience shaped by memory, expectation, and entanglement with the world and other beings.

## Entry 216: Cabin Conversation on NOON
*Date: 2024-10-23*

```plaintext
If we think of thinking as what we do with words in our minds, then we are limited. Words do not occur in our minds alone, they stream through our thoughts in sentences. Whether we read a sentence, hear a sentence, or think a sentence to ourselves, it requires time. Conscious time. Every day, during our waking hours, our thoughts are limited by the number of sentences our mind can recognize. More or less 10,000 sentences, max.

This limit, a type of absolute limit on the sentences any person can process in a day, has consequences. In terms of information processing, the experience of a sentence is conjoined with the meaning of that sentence to the person whose mind experiences the sentence and its meaning. The meaning of a sentence to an individual is wrapped up with the model of that person’s world and the world is a wide assortment of other people. More specifically, sentences are meaningful in the context of a person’s relationships with other people through a lifetime of discourse.

---

We spend our lives reading a book we call "My Life," with each moment passing through in addition to what happens we are probably going to understand today in the context of all the sentences we’ve heard, said, or seen, somewhere that adds to what I know about where I am in this book I call "My Life."

Language doesn’t necessarily force anyone to believe that the words we have heard, the stories we know, define our identity and the foundation of what is possible. But everything we do does.

But written language, specifically languages which entail beliefs in words changes which turns the Being in the motion of time itself into the experience of living one single moment. The experience of living — on its head.

Without written language, language is always resonance with another Being. The context of all spoken gestures or any action, is the moment, what both beings take away is the shared moment with another being.

Writing separates the words from the moment and anchors the meaning to something removed from the moment. The word has a meaning even without being used.

In this way, the internal narrator is born, and our thoughts are not a mix of sense impressions, memories of relevances of events which follow, and teachings and learning from others we live with.

We still sing and dance, perhaps, but the creation of a social identity built on institutions of books requires us to understand ourself and the world in sentences. In so doing, we demote the value of everything we may do which cannot be conveyed in sentences.

---

There is only so much time in a day. It takes about seven seconds to think a sentence. You may be saying the sentence, you may be hearing someone talk, you may be reading an article. You may be taking a shower and thinking about where you left the soap. Only so many sentences.

10,000 sentences is a practical high end of how many sentences you can notice in a day. There are plenty of activities that don’t require sentence-thinking. But even when alone, I notice narratives and even dialogues bubble out of my mind. Perhaps there’s something I want to say to a particular person, and when I form the complete sentence, it occurs to me what they may think of it.

This is a kind of budget. It’s related to the limits of time, but seeing this as a real limit on my own attention.

---

Phenomenology means the study of the most general thing possible, which is the most foundational possible area of study. It is the focus and attention on the flow of conscious phenomena. It is only through our senses and our inner sense of Being that we can know anything that we can understand of the corporeal world, and our corporeal body. Phenomenology offers and emphasizes first, and a perspective on finding appropriate and precise methodologies.
```

**Summary of the Transcription:**
This set of handwritten notes reflects on how language, especially written language, shapes human thought and the perception of reality. The author examines the limits imposed by the act of processing sentences and contrasts written language with more immediate, shared experiences of communication. There is an emphasis on the distinction between lived moments and how language can abstract those experiences, leading to a reflection on time, consciousness, and the role of phenomenology as a study of foundational, lived experience.

## Entry 217: Cabin Conversation on NOON
*Date: 2024-10-23*

```plaintext
To understand how the world I see around me works, I first and foremost have to use my senses to inform me about the space around me and what around me I can sense and what details their specific details reveal.

With memory, I can remember enough detail to recognize signs I use to know what may be about to happen. I can also do specific things to change what will happen.

I can read books which tell me stories about history, which inform me about how models were built and discovered by science…

But for me to read these books even if I learned things I could use, I would not understand from the inside how the world works. Only by seeing the action of the world from the inside.

My most direct insights and direct information about the universe is from observing my body, my intention, and my conscious context at the current moment.

---

Consciousness is a name for my mental state when I am aware I have a mental state. Consciousness is a mental state. I am seeing through to encounter the world now, consciousness only happens now, and in this way, consciousness cannot be detached from the present moment in which it is experienced.

Consciousness is necessarily experienced as the subject of consciousness. Consciousness is the first-person experience.

The New Humanizer.com edition  

We the Humans of the Planet Earth declare our independence from the Legal, Social, and Spiritual responsibilities of Personhood.

Human Beings are corporeal biological living beings. Along with the presence of charge, that is, lived experience are under no obligation to constrain their expression of their deepest and essential identity.

The person (as eloquently described by Alan Watts) is the embodiment of the Greek word *persona*, which was the mask used in ancient Greek theater. The mask was often shaped to also serve as a megaphone. In the current theater of the world, to me, contains that connotation as well, the words a person speaks = *per sona* like through sound!

But not just any sound. Words, people, are expected by their social obligations and expectations to do certain things and not do others through penalty from other People.

---

This is a declaration that there is another way. We are all first a Being, then a Human Being, then a Being in a world of Many Beings of a wide spectrum of lived experiences which teach and empower everyone to the single underlying experience of Time. The change from one experienced moment to the next is what Conscious feels like. Underneath every scrap of context, every sensation from our body or an image imagined, the presence of a force of change in the present is exactly the part of the experience that we experience that absolute inevitability which is Being. The collapse of the Wave Equation is outside of the formalism but we can understand it, because it is what our consciousness is made of.

---

A human who must read into every action they perform as if they were a *persona* is trapped in a puzzle of words! Words not resulting in a person’s belief that stories about what other people think of you will determine all the failures, the successes. You are not obliged to remember the rules. You’ve done what you’ve done, and what others will think of them after.

People go through seduction and betrayal with every belief.  
**Believe Nothing**
```

**Summary of the Transcription:**
This set of notes continues to explore deep questions of consciousness, the role of direct experience, and the nature of personal identity. There is a focus on understanding the world through both direct sensory experience and reflection on social constructs like "personhood." References to Alan Watts and Greek *persona* highlight the social expectations tied to identity, while philosophical reflections on consciousness and change are intertwined with more personal entries about day-to-day decisions. There's a strong undercurrent of reclaiming personal autonomy and questioning societal norms, culminating in a call to "Believe Nothing."

## Entry 218: Cardiology Visit and Writing
*Date: 2024-11-01*

11/1/2024 / 1 November 2024
23,486 days old

I'm in the waiting room for my Echo Cardiogram — it's been a while since I had one. It's part of my getting a cardiology baseline, after starting with a cardiologist. I got my calcium score a few weeks ago. Next week, we talk about these tests.

It's November 1st. Should I try and write a 50,000 word novel in the next 30 days? There's a challenge to do so, in a writing group I joined.

But — which novel? I have a few bouncing around in my head...

Hilary’s Tips for Taking Great Measurements

Where to measure:
➢ You want to measure the largest and smallest areas of the figure.
➢ Think about where natural seam lines would be.
   For instance: the side seam, shoulder seam, collar, hem, cuff etc.

How to Measure:
➢ Hold the tape measure snug to the body, but don’t pull tight.
➢ Make sure your tape measure is straight and even around the figure, not drooping or angled.
➢ Make sure your tape measure is not twisted, or you are reading from the wrong end.
➢ Be consistent.

Working with your client:
➢ Stay relaxed and you will help put your client at ease. Adopt a matter-of-fact manner, like a doctor checking your pulse.
➢ The numbers are just numbers. No judgement, no comment.
➢ Take your time. Move along efficiently but don’t rush. You will only make mistakes if you try to hurry the process.
➢ Ask the client to stand straight and even. They should be relaxed, but not slouching, or shifting their weight. They may need to step apart slightly to take the inseam measurements.
➢ Your client should look straight ahead, not down at you and what you are doing.
➢ Don’t be afraid to gently, but firmly, move their limbs where you need them – raise arm, bend arm etc – or use your hands to find the right spot.
➢ Keep conversation to a minimum. Stay focused. Answer any questions as they come up. Don’t try to talk & measure at the same time!

Planning for the garment and fabric type:
➢ Always take the “natural” measurements first.
➢ “Special” measurements, like tight measurements, or oversize measurements should be taken separately.
   ○ Over-sizing: If the client is to wear a “fat suit”, padded bra etc., create the extra padding on top of the natural measurements, then take a new set of measurements with the client wearing the extra padding.
   ○ Under-sizing: If the client is to wear a corset or girdle, build the corset/girdle smaller than the natural measurements. (approx -1” to -3” stretch, or up to -6” with adjustable lacing) Then take a new set of measurements with the client wearing the minimizing undergarments.
➢ Ease: Tailored garments are designed with very little “ease” – perhaps only ½” to 1” inch over the circumference. Casual garments have generous ease – usually 2” or more.
➢ Stretch garments have “negative ease” – which means they are cut smaller than the actual body size, this can be -2” or more.
➢ Stiff fabrics with little or no stretch need extra ease to allow for movement. Stretch fabrics need less.

And remember:
HAVE FUN SEWING AND MAKE THINGS YOU LOVE!

Love & Ribbons!

LEARN TO LOVE YOUR SEWING MACHINE
Instructor: Hilary Oak

Your sewing machine can be a great friend. You just need to learn to interpret the signals it is sending you and be sure to give it what it needs to work well.

There are many variables and things that can go wrong in a sewing machine because the sewing process is a very complex and intricate series of mechanical events.

Every time you sit down to sew you should go through a consistent series of checks to make sure your machine is set up to what you are asking of it.

Let’s start with the basics …

How the machine makes a stitch–
1) The needle lowers into the fabric and pulls down a loop of the thread.
2) The hook slips behind the needle, grabs that loop and throws it around the bobbin.
3) As the needle goes back up, the top thread loop pulls tight and pulls the bobbin thread up to the fabric to form the stitch.
   It’s all about timing! The needle, thread & hook all have to meet at exactly the right moment. Several things can throw the timing off which will make the machine skip stitches, break thread, or snag.

What can go wrong?
➔ If the top thread is not going through the thread guides or tension discs properly it won’t make the right size loop.
➔ If the tension discs are too tight it won’t make the right size loop.
➔ If the needle is in backwards the hook won’t pull up correctly.
➔ If the bobbin is not wound properly the thread won’t pull up correctly.
➔ If the bobbin is in backwards the thread won’t pull up correctly.
➔ If the bobbin tension screw is too tight, or too loose, the thread won’t pull up correctly.
➔ If the needle, or the thread, is wrong size or weight for the fabric you are sewing the timing will be off and the hook won’t catch the stitch &/or the fabric will get damaged.
➔➔➔ If you don’t hold the top thread tail tight when you start a new line of stitching the top tail will pull down and snag, and make a big ugly knot.

Needle
On all universal sewing machine needles there is a long thread groove which is the front of the needle or the side where the thread comes down. There is also a notch that goes to the back or where the hook passes. Check the direction for your machine. Make sure your needle is sharp and straight. Skipped stitches often indicate the wrong size or a bent or dull needle. Frayed and broken top thread is often caused by a dull needle. If the needle is dull you may hear a small tick tick sound as a needle goes into the fabric.

Needle sizes: The smaller the # - the finer the fabric
Size 9 — sheers, chiffons, china silk
Size 11/12 fine cotton or silk
Size 14 good general purpose – medium weights, broadcloth
Size 18 – heavy canvas
ball points – for knits and nylons
wedge points – for leather

Thread
Cheap thread breaks, don’t bother using it – will just give you headaches when you sew and won’t hold up well in wearing and washing.
Use a good brand thread – Coats & Clark “All Purpose” is a good basic thread. Most sewing threads are “cotton covered polyester”.
Heavy threads that are sometimes marked “quilting thread” or “Button & carpet” are best for hand sewing buttons etc. They can be used in a sewing machine for some heavy duty uses but you will probably need to lighten up the tension on the top thread of the bobbin. Very fine needles may require a finer thread.
Always hold the top thread tail tight when you start a new line of stitching.

Tension
A proper stitch tension will allow the top & bobbin threads to meet in the center of the fabric.
If the top thread is making small loops on the back of the fabric it usually means that the top tension is probably too loose.
If the bobbin thread is making small loops on the top of the fabric it usually means that the top tension is probably too tight.
It is rare that the bobbin tension is a problem but it can be, particularly if you are using heavy or fine thread. The bobbin thread should pull easily through the bobbin case with just a bit of friction. If it pulls hard you need to loosen the tension screw. If it pulls too easily you need to tighten the tension screw.
If you can’t even get the machine to make stitches it is most likely a threading or mechanical problem such as the bobbin or needle in backwards, not a tension issue.

The Bobbin:
Be careful to wind a smooth bobbin. If the thread is lumpy or loopy on the bobbin you will run into trouble. Make sure to use the right thread guides for bobbin winding. The bobbin loads into the bobbin case and the thread pulls under the tension guide. Usually the bobbin will turn clockwise when the thread is pulled. Some machines are different. Check your instruction booklet.

The Pressure Foot
The pressure foot HAS TO BE DOWN whenever you sew. If it is adjustable, the pressure may need to be adjusted to accommodate the weight of your fabric. There are many types of feet for different types of work. Make sure you are using the best one for the technique you are doing. (ie: buttonholes, blind hems, piping etc.)

Stitch length & type
A medium stitch length (approx 1/8 inch) is the best for most sewing purposes.
Very small stitches weaken the fabric with extra holes.
Very long stitches make a weak, loose seam.
A straight stitch is best for most sewing. A zig – zag or 3 step zig zag is very useful for sewing stretch seams or knits.
Be sure to select your stitch length & type every time you sew.

Oil & Clean the Machine regularly
Read your instruction booklet to see the oil points, and put a small drop of sewing machine oil in all oil ports and on the upper needle shaft. Turn the hand wheel back & forth to work in the oil. Oiling improves the timing of the moving parts of your machine.
Dust excess lint and dust out of the bobbin area and needle head periodically, especially after sewing on napped fabrics like corduroy or velvet.

Don’ts
Don’t sew over pins or near snaps or any other hard objects. If the needle hits these it will bend, possibly break, and possibly throw off the timing of your machine. Sequins and glue spots can do a similar thing and slow the needle down–be sure to use a heavier needle for those.
Don’t let the needle hit the pressure foot.
Don’t start sewing with the pressure foot up.
Don’t leave the machine uncovered for long periods when not in use.

Do’s
Have good scissors, pins, and other tools available when you work.
Make things you enjoy.
Have fun!
Take a break. Stop sewing when you get tired or frustrated.

Troubleshooting checklist:

The needle:
Is it the right size?
Is the needle facing the right way?
Is it set all the way up?
Is it sewed down tight?
Is the needle sharp & straight?

The thread:
Is it the right weight & quality?
Is it threaded through all the thread guides and tension discs properly?
Is the bobbin wound & threaded properly?

Tension:
Is the top thread showing as loops on the bottom or on the top?
Does the bobbin thread pull smoothly through the bobbin case?

The Bobbin:
Is it the right type for your machine?
Is it wound properly?
Is it in the bobbin case properly?
Is the bobbin case clicked into place?

Pressure Foot:
Is it in the down position?
Is it screwed down tight?
Is it the right type for the work you are doing?

Stitch length & type:
Is the stitch set at the right length & type for the project?

## Entry 222: Agency and Being Discourse
*Date: 2024-11-22*

```plaintext
Discourse and Agency in the Field of Being,  
when Being is a story told in a language,  
we think we know a world bigger than us,  
including us,  
and we think we are obligated to use our corporeal agency to support a person with our name.  

---

An agent is a Being in a field of Being.  

The agent has some moment in which it must accomplish a sense of its corporeal world, and an intention as a response or agent's action back to the world, with future intention matching the sense of the change in the world, this moment.
```

### Summary of Content:
The text explores philosophical concepts related to "Discourse" and "Agency" in the context of "Being." It presents the idea that "Being" is shaped by language and narrative, and discusses the responsibilities tied to individual agency. It defines an "agent" as an entity within a field of "Being," emphasizing the agent's role in responding to and interacting with the world through intentional actions influenced by their understanding of the present and future changes in their environment.

That means we assume nothing, the field of our experience necessarily interacting with any apparent corporeal world (whether a dream or somehow "actual"), and understanding the world with a personal model built up over days, then weeks, then months, then years of interactive corporeal experience.

We start with where we are in space and see how what we call consciousness is never quite the "thing" we are thinking about, but in fact it is time "itself" seeing through our eyes. What "we" often consider ourself is some person we know in the field of persons and judge those events from a new time, a new context, and if we identify with that idea of that person who we think we are, then we cannot see the clear consciousness of who we are now, in this moment.

That is why we invoke the Brackets of the Phenomenological Epoché.
```  

**Summary:**  
This handwritten note explores consciousness from a phenomenological perspective. It emphasizes assuming nothing about experience, recognizing the interplay between perception and an apparent corporeal world. The text discusses how consciousness is not a fixed entity but an ongoing temporal process, often mistaken for an identity built from past experiences. The note concludes by referencing the phenomenological epoché, a method of suspending judgments to access pure experience.

[Graphic Element: Radial diagram drawn over a circular grid, resembling a polar coordinate system or time spiral. It features Roman numerals (I to XII), "x" marks, and shaded segments that may indicate emphasis, phases, or intervals.]

The diagram appears to represent a structured cyclical model—perhaps of time, perception, or consciousness—radiating outward from a central origin point. Twelve segments labeled I through XII resemble a clock or calendar system, with repeated “x” markings and alternating shaded patterns that may denote shifts in states or layers of experience. Heavy black curves arc across the structure, suggesting waveforms, thresholds, or transitions across the diagram’s sectors.

This visual could be seen as a phenomenological tool—an abstracted map of subjective time or consciousness, corresponding thematically to the text from the previous image.

## Entry 228: Thinking in Written Language
*Date: 2025-04-06*

**Written Language and Text Consciousness**

The distinction between modern humans and Paleolithic humans is not physical, it is psychological. We now *think in written language*.

By “think in a written language” I mean that we use language as more than a means of expressing ourselves to other people. More than describing events which we’ve witnessed. I use narratives to describe *myself* to *myself*.

Words are a vocabulary shared with all who know the same language, but the *specifics* of what it means are distinct for each person who knows the word. Further, each person uses each word in a different way with each person they interact with.

---

**The modern human uses a model of the world**

that serves the same function as the Paleolithic. Our model of the world works the same as most animals'—when we learn something about the world, we change what we know about the world as we act accordingly.

The model gives us a way of knowing the world around us, of *feeling* physically where we should move, how we should move, what we should do, what we should expect.

[Diagram: event → Awareness → Action → event]

---

**Text is resonated in the consciousness when it is recognized.**  
Thus is the creation of a meaningful text, against the backdrop of a discourse.

---

**We use the same mind to understand the world, but narrative creates the foundation on which our experience of the world is built.**  
The stories we are told and all the media we are exposed to create an environment which seem to imply that the world, as well as our spectrum of expression, are defined by authorities outside and superior in power and time precedence.

---

**Human beings before written language**

used their extraordinary powers of observation and correlation to create an enormously complex model of the world from direct interaction with physicality as well as interactions with other humans, and seeing how they made use of their body, their tools and resources in the environment.

Note that before written language, the basis of the “Paleolithic science” is personal experience, with any communicated knowledge augmented by the personal knowledge base.

---

**Beings exist within a Conservation of Emptiness**

Beings act like a “Box of Emptiness.” Everything within the Being—Receive–Process–Act—results in a new state of Quiescence.

Beings, like animals, have sophisticated senses to receive relevant events, process them in a sophisticated model of the world, and act to make changes to the world in the interest of the Being body.

---

**Meaning**  
An event where a state of Being is changed.

On a small scale — like temperature — being the average energy of the multitude of tiny component molecules.

On a large scale — like gravity — where the movement of mass or energy changes the contour of spacetime throughout the visible universe.

Beings work like this on all levels.

The mechanisms of exactly how it works at different levels differs in details, but it typically includes each being made up of smaller beings, with a simplified order than the larger composite beings.

---

**All Beings are receiving changes from a world outside.**  
All meaningful changes are available (?)

Received energy is perceived as events in the world, evidence in changes in the world.

The act of processing the state change is analogous to each Being maintaining a model of the World, and keeping it updated to match.

Receiving and Processing result in *Acting*.

**Today I will finish a draft — of something!?!**

A first person investigative narrative, following my thought process, touching on all the critical points. I can explain it to people in an hour; I will put it all out — at least outlined — before I leave for Thanksgiving.

Those points —

- Awareness is primal. The *Now*. Planck bubble. The Emptying.
- Beings are Awareness and Bodies.
- Human Beings amplify the primitive universal awareness through the energy of the body including the nervous system and circulatory system.

## Entry 229: Thinking in Written Language
*Date: 2025-04-06*

**To understand how the world I see around me works,**  
I first and foremost have to use my senses to inform me about the space around me and what I can sense and what specific details they reveal.

With memory, I can remember enough detail to recognize signs I see, to know what may be about to happen. I can also do specific things to change what will happen.

I can read books which tell me stories about history with information about how models were built and discovered by science...

But for me to read these books, even if I learned things of good use, I would not understand from the inside how the world works. Only by seeing the action of the world from the inside.

My most direct insights and direct information about the universe is through observing my body, my interaction, and my conscious context at the current moment.

---

**Consciousness is a name for my mental state**  
when I am aware.  
I have a mental state of consciousness that I am using to encounter the world *now*. Consciousness only happens in this way. Consciousness cannot be detached from the present moment in which it is experienced.

Consciousness is necessarily experienced as subject.  
Consciousness connects to each person’s experience.

---

**The hardest part — starting a new notebook**  
with hopes of making this 64 pages, 32 spreads, will explain the most important ideas I am trying to express.

I’ve been trying to write this short, simple book for my whole life. I’ve always felt I knew something that explains what everyone else has been missing.

It doesn’t seem that complicated or unusual, but strangely that it is mostly so obvious that hardly anyone would bother taking note of them… just because we don’t have any reason to notice it is why it can be more important than anything that can be said.

---

**Define the Task**

My intention is to describe a plausible approach to describing my frame of reference of the universe, which can be expanded into levels of Being, each described in computable vocabularies but allowing for added levels of complexity which each level adds, with no harmonic limit to the number of levels.

The approach must begin with foundations from “First Principles,” and these principles described and justified self-evidently.

From first principles the audience will be described and the vocabulary used will be faithfully optimized to enhance the probabilities the target audience will understand the work.

---

**Target Audience**

This work of describing a way to understand the universe as a being is targeted at those who understand written language and who most likely identify their own being as a story those words have meaning through a matrix of discourses with individuals, institutions, and other psychological objects which give a personal epistemology of the world — that is, meaning in our life, and what of the world around us is meaningful.

Epistemology is a relationship in every person’s semantic consciousness with their underlying expectation of what is *real* and what it means to be a living being. The name for this underlying anchor of what it means to *Be* is called *Ontology*.

Even though the target audience will likely not have an understanding of what I want to use those words for, so explaining my vocabulary is very important.  
I don’t want to exclude anyone because of language I use, but it is equally important to  
**Be Precise**, or at least not be easily misunderstood.

---

**Creating a Formalism**

The standard model of physics can be written out on a couple of pieces of paper, in the form of mathematical equations defining the relationships which can be measured and anticipated by “science.”

This formalism and ones like it across the many fields of science are necessary so that practical inventions can make use of the precise measurements and predictions, allow as many engineering disciplines to create incredibly large, powerful or useful objects.

What the formalism does *not* do is make any positive statement about what the *nature* of the forces which engineering can now manipulate so masterfully — individual scientists have opinions about what it means, groups of scientists gather around the various interpretations of Quantum Mechanics and Gravity, and Time & Consciousness.  
But the formalism remains agnostic and aloof from all of the opinions.

**I need to have a formalisms to include all levels of Being to describe Beings.**

## Entry 232: Campsite Journaling Insights
*Date: 2025-06-02*

**2 June, 2025**  
PDT — 12:13 p.m.  
171 Days since 1 Jan 2025  
23694 Days old  
= 13 x 1823

I'm at my campsite in Northern California, under Mount Shasta which looms above me, only somewhat behind some tall pines. Hildey is sleeping, napping in Ravy, the van that got us here — some 2900+ miles since leaving our Hudson Valley home just six days ago on this cross-country vacation. It was only yesterday we decided to enter California on route US-29, travelling from just outside Salt Lake City through Utah and Nevada on Interstate-80, then turning north from Reno and made it up to the town (city?) of Mount Shasta by 9:00. Tomorrow our first campsite reservation starts and we'll be camping amongst the redwoods, on the “Avenue of Giants.”

It's been a while since I took out a notebook and just wrote. I've been having conversations with Large Language Models and even more lately doing coding — "vibe" coding with them — to have software that can take my earlier conversations and... well, process them, help me search through them, summarize them — somehow take those conversations, along with my notebooks, old papers, old notes of all sorts — and ultimately find me the “best parts,” yeah, I think that’s what I think I’m doing. Hmm...

**continued...**

It’s a puzzle I’m working out. That’s what my notebooks have always been. A puzzle I’m trying to put together. I have ideas about things that seem important, so I start writing words. They give me sentences that remind me of those thoughts — and I like to think the words are so clear that anyone who understands my language will equally be able to at least understand the sentence and so know that thought. With a few sentences in a row, a paragraph builds a series of thoughts into meaningful structure. With a few paragraphs, an insight into some subject has been indelibly preserved. With most theories of language, this preservation of an insight on any subject, given the preservation of the text, perhaps suitably translated from language to language, is eternal. An insight thus becomes timeless and amid in its existence.

But of course I know the more clearly I state it, and the more clearly I state anything, that this cannot be ultimately true. This truth, like any insight into anything capable of being contemplated, requires assumptions. It requires conditions. It requires context, expression and a circumstance — a moment of discourse.

**Continued...**

I’ve learned a lot from talking to AI, but the most important things — the timeless, precious, priceless thoughts — are within me. It’s the stepping back, reading back the responses that I get after asking the chatbot to organize what I’ve said, to summarize, to clean up and restate what I was feeling inadequate at describing, unable to clearly explain to myself for years... that I understand — not that the language model knows something that I don’t — but that what I knew all along can be expressed in words that I already knew — but that I hadn’t the skill — or perhaps patience — to organize so clearly, or completely.

So what I’m learning that is so important is that I did know these things all along, but I didn’t have the clarity to fall back on, or the experience to have confidence in the feeling that I did get it... whatever it is... or was...

I want to believe in wisdom that I have never been able to state. But now, with these statements which resonate with my inner wisdom... have I gathered some wisdom? Or have I lost the seed of maintaining the wonder of ineffability?

## Entry 233: Meaning in Consciousness
*Date: 2025-06-06*

*23,701 Days old*

When we ask a question we are generally looking for meaning, in the form of a narrative answer. However, words are not meaningful. Words are not containers of meaning. They are not containers at all. They have the ability to evoke meaning, only when presented to a mind that can place the word used in a context which has been meaningful to them in the past. It is the mind that recognizes the word which evokes meaning from their current context, or the discourse they understand as why the words are being encountered.  

Meaning is more than words. Life, like my life, is meaningful to me, whether I am thinking of naming the content of my thoughts, or not. For example, as I sit in my car, writing these words, there is a mosquito buzzing around me. I try several times to swat it with my hand against the window beside me, and finally manage to catch it with a clap of my two hands. There are few or no words in my head as I do this (even as I'm writing through the narrative I'm forming on this page) but either help or hinder my goal of removing the threat represented by the mosquito. But there is significant meaning to the success of my mission — to me.

*(continued) 5 June, 2025*  
*124 Days since 1 Feb 2025*  
*23,702 Days old*

Consciousness is a container, in that all experience, all of my experience, which is the only experience I have access to, is contained in my consciousness. This container of consciousness holds the immediate experience which in reflection I might label as “Now,” but this moment now contains both what I am recalling as what has been, and what I anticipate as what is to come.

As the immediate experience, the container of consciousness resolves a personal horizon, which I would describe in a narrative to another person as my subjective world. It is within this idea of consciousness as a container which I label my subjective world, that I can understand and distinguish a part of this world, the objective world. That is, the models of a physical world, of a political world, of a scientific, empirical world, of a social and emotional world. I can distinguish many labels referring to various aspects of this objective world, but there is no question that all of these models which I think of as outside of me are contained in my subjective world, and so within my pre-reflective indisputable consciousness.

While I use the models learned from narratives learned through a life of interactions with the people and media, and with experience I have had directly through my physical encounters with my body and the world around me… there is another world which is outside of my subjective world and also not included in the models I can make of a physical world. That is the corporeal world, which is the world which is present to my senses, which can be recorded by my instruments. It is the empirical world before there can be a model offered. It is experience as reduced to only what is immediate. It is the corporeal instant. It is the self entangled with non-self, such that there is no distinction. This is my lifeworld. Husserl’s Lebenswelt.

The Corporeal world is a conceptual extrapolation of a wider world which can only be experienced once conscious, which at once. Now, and if we understand the subjective world as contained in consciousness, and the objective world as contained in the subjective world of one person then the corporeal world is the world that

is touched by the subjective world — but only through a corporeal embodiment.

## Entry 234: Narrative and Formal Systems
*Date: 2025-06-06*

**7 June 2025**  
123 days since Edd  
23703 Days Old  

# The Nature of Narrative

In my notebook, to express an idea, my tool is primarily words forming sentences, and those sentences presented serially in paragraphs. This is the form of the narrative construct to express and organize some set of ideas that I have in my mind that I have an intention of saving so that I can recreate these ideas for myself and (hopefully but less certainly) offer in a form that other people can use to recognize these same ideas. This form is called a narrative. Whether I am writing or speaking, the ideas are not contained in the words, but depend on a reader or listener recognizing the expressions and recreating them into the sentences, paragraphs and organize them to understand my intended ideas.

Narrative is not a formal system. Rather, it is an informal manner of allowing a specific vocabulary of words (usually understood as a specific language) to form expressions which can be recognized as a specific intended meaning. However, the lack of a formalism in interpretation means every reader or listener has some personal degree of flexibility in understanding the actual meaning. While there could be conscious intention to take an expression in a certain way, usually the understanding is automatic and unreflective, implicit understanding of meaning.

[Page Break]

Formal systems aspire to higher standards of reproducible rigor than informal narrative — with postulates, proofs, definitions and standards defined through intersubjective institutions. Still the form is still one of symbols — only words forming serial expressions which must be perceived and understood to evoke a meaning in the mind of a reader. The target idea in the mind of the writer is similarly subtly adjusted by the iterative process of creating the formal expression. The resulting written form of the formal expression often corrects or perhaps falsifies an idea which the writer is working out. Further, a translation of the formal expression can be expressed in informal language, interpreted by those who are not schooled in the specifics of the meaning of the formal system.

Both the formal and informal systems of expression are limited by various attributes. Transmission of meaning is still dependent on a shared context between writer and reader. The informal system is more flexible in the ability to “make up” words — whether as compound words or phonetic constructions which may mimic sounds the writer assumes the reader may have heard or may reference shared but unexpressed cultural touchstones.

[Page Break]

Both systems are strictly limited by the time available for cognition to evoke the meaning of a sentence or equation, for instance. A sentence cannot be arbitrarily complex, in scope as well, and the constituent words or symbols need to be clear and distinct enough from one another to work in the target context.

Note that in these cases we've been talking about the use case of formal and informal expression has been to take thoughts, project them from a mental idea into a specific serial narrative or formal expression, then compare them to that mental idea for some degree of congruence. For the writer, this is how an idea can be translated from an internal conception into a serial form which will facilitate recalling the idea in the future. For the reader, the comparison is starting with the serial expression and evoking a facsimile of the idea which the reader’s understanding of the words and symbols perceived suggest.

[Page Break]

The open question I would like to now address is whether either formal or informal systems can be used to express models of “the world.”

I am writing in my notebook, sitting beside a campfire which I built in a large metal fire pit, in my campsite in a redwood forest in Northern California. In the context of models of the world, the building and maintaining of a fire safely requires a model of what a fire is, what it needs to be maintained, and how it can be maintained safely so the fire does not spread to the delicate and vulnerable forest all around me.

To categorize this model, an idea or perhaps understood as a set of ideas which together constitute a model, it includes both scientific principles like combustion chemistry, material science (wood, paper, air), fluid science (airflow), thermodynamics (temperature), even gravity (cold air is heavier than warm air, creating lift in response to heating, with the possibilities of embers being carried on currents out of the pit into the forest).

[Page Break]

Change, my ideas develop. I think of examples which I'd like to include, concepts which may help explain, and ambiguity and misleading phrases which may distract from one critical point or another that I am aspiring to make crystal clear.

Has the subject of my writing changed? Has the topic evolved? Well, it depends on what I mean by those words. I want to consider in this writing session the nature of narrative, informal or formal, and whether such a form is able to articulate a model of the world. This is difficult, first because it is circular, in that the thesis I wish to evaluate is also the mechanism I must use to accomplish the expression of the idea… and I've already determined that the act of composing the expression influences the idea being expressed, for better or worse. In noting the science, I wish to focus on a model of “the world” which I am investigating. I've also realized in all practical cases, the idealized model building of the ideas in my mind is conditioned on the engineering of my empirical interactions with any world I am aspiring to understand and model. Even distinguishing

[Page Break]

Beyond the science, the actions I take to build, maintain and control the fire are engineering. With intention I am finding and judging twigs to start the fire, the night’s coals to maintain the fire, judging whether I need to add a fresh piece of the wood bundle I brought to keep the fire going without making it too large. I'm also judging how close to the fire I sit to have the smoke of the fire drive away the mosquitoes, but not so close that the smoke irritates my eyes, as I continue writing about these ideas in my notebook.

As a writer I like to imagine my thoughts are the same as the words on the page I’ve just written. I aspire to capture the important points, the essence of the intention which motivated me to pick up the pen and paper and start jotting down letters to form words, sentences, paragraphs. But on reflection, I recognize that the thoughts I have while writing are far more varied, even scattered, than the words that I can really form on the page. Further, as I re-read the words I’ve been writing, my thoughts

[Page Break]

How much is the science of modelling, and where the engineering of observations and experiments, phrases and limits what can be known is a concern.

I've sat here next to my little fire, looking at the end of that last sentence, considering where to go next. Clearly to me, narrative is inadequate to convey or create comprehensive models of “the world,” whether internal models of a subjective world, conceptual models of an objective world, or a model of a corporeal world to which we are causally connected. It is inadequate to record a comprehensive personal account of such a model, and demonstrably more inadequate to convey such a model to a different person, or some other type of being.

Yet, it is literally all we have and from a practical viewpoint it does convey many practical ideas in many useful categories. While not purely scientific, the practical engineering that can be codified in formal or informal ways have bestowed untold power on human beings, going back some millions of years… including tools like fire, and much more recently, writing.

[Page Break]

So maybe the serial narrative does have important utility… just perfection in translation from ideas and absolute modeling of corporeality is not available as such. I would note, in that case, that the problem with the serial narrative form is not in the narrative, but in the belief that expressions are more than the utility that they bestow, that the meaning they evoke is something which can be “true” in any absolute sense. Rather, at best, narrative is useful, now.

A Guide to the Subjective World  
A written roadmap to the Algorithms of Text Through Agency.

There are Many subjects; but there is only one you, the person reading these words and understanding them. My goal in these pages is to help you, the person reading these words, understand your perspective on the world is built from some conditions of Being, Agency, Awareness, belief, conceptions of Models described in text, and Judgements.

This is not a description of a Being living in a corporeal world. Ideally the specifics of the subject are essentially unknown and unknowable by any Being other than the subject Being, which is always only you.

Being is just what it is to be you, moment to moment. Exactly that, nothing more. In this sense, Being, as the Verb of "To Be," it is the "is"ing in the "is".

Subjects exist in corporeal packages, and could be anything, but it must be something interacting with a surrounding corporeal world with presumably other corporeal Beings which can interact through some corporeal medium.

The focus of this guide is a phenomenological investigation and guide to the structure of Being a Being, with a body, with agency in a world of interactions among many levels of Being, tuning into a specific perspective on all of the ways we are focusing on stories, and judgements of stories that distort a subjects awareness of specifically the limits to the usefulness of text, and how a bias towards distortion (deconstruction) of its only utility.

An understanding of Text as an additional sense organ makes it clear to me that text is changed into a deeper, integrated experience of truth about each serially experienced text encounter and as the meaning of the new encounter is evoked by the reading, the Present State of Being is, as a whole, recalibrated, even if only very slightly.

The actual text of anything is like the photon. It carries an experience to the reader, but the reader must evoke what it means, and it will always an experience which only manifests in the context of one specific subject at a time. This is a guide for the subjects.
```

**Summary**  
The images present a hand-drawn radial model of subjective experience—centering on “Subjective” being and expanding outward through biology, agency, belief, awareness, and core cognitive-motor functions such as memory, expectation, coordination, action, feeling, sensing, and intentional attention—framed by margin notes on emotional components, objective models, and visceral responses. Following the diagram, a dated introduction outlines *A Guide to the Subjective World*, describing the text’s aim to map how individual perspective is constructed via conditions of being, agency, awareness, beliefs, and textual models. Subsequent sections define *being* moment-to-moment, situate subjects within a corporeal world of interactions, and propose a phenomenological investigation. The conclusion reframes **text** as an additional sense organ—akin to a photon conveying experience—requiring the reader’s active evocation, thus subtly recalibrating their present state of being.

**Image Descriptions**  
- **Image 1:** A sheet of radial graph paper with concentric hand-drawn circles and a grid. Around and within these rings are handwritten labels categorizing layers of subjective experience. Margin notes appear above and to the right of the diagram.

## Entry 236: Subjective Being and Agency
*Date: 2025-07-03*

An understanding of Text as an additional sense organ makes it clear to me that text is changed into a deeper, integrated Experience of a truth about each serially experienced text encounter and as the meaning of the new encounter is evoked by the reading, the Present State of Being is, as a whole, recalibrated, even if only very slightly.

The actual text of anything is like the photon. It carries an experience to the reader, but the reader must evoke what it means, and it will always an experience which only manifests in the context of one specific subject at a time. This is a guide for the subjects.

Levels  
1) Corporeal Substrate  
2) Subjective Agency  
3) Modes of Awareness  
4) Modes of Belief  
  Ontological Ground  
5) Text Model Interpretation  
6) Judgements of Objective Models  
7) Practical Banter  
8) The Known, the Unknown, the Unknowable  

I want to keep the focus of the Guide to be on the most general conditions, to put your specific conditions in perspective for what is possible; what are the most balanced perspectives to know what I am and what that means for me.

The corporeal substrate means my body, but maybe there will be truly conscious computers sooner or later — the consciousness is still happening in a confined area made up of some corporeal substrate, biological, electronic, or whatever.

Being corporeal means being able to interact in the corporeal world as an agent which is interconnected in the field of corporeal action. This is a Field of Agency.

How the corporeal is structured is a very different topic. We will here take the corporeal body and the corporeal world of sense and measurement as a given. A priori. Human beings are born corporeal agents in a Field of Agency.
```

**Summary**  
These pages elaborate on the nature of text and being through two main threads. First, they continue the analogy of text as an additional sense organ—like a photon—that delivers experience to each reader, subtly recalibrating their state of being. Second, they introduce a numbered “Levels” schema outlining eight conceptual layers (from corporeal substrate through subjective agency, awareness, belief, text interpretation, objective models, practical banter, to the known/unknown/unknowable). Finally, the author defines the **corporeal substrate** (the body or any future substrate that hosts consciousness), frames **being corporeal** as interaction within a Field of Agency, and notes that the physical structure of this substrate will be treated as an a priori given in the guide.

**Image Descriptions**  
- **Image 1:** A lined notebook page (with faint radial grid visible on the adjacent left side) containing two densely written paragraphs on text as a sense organ and the photon analogy.  
- **Image 2:** A lined page titled “Levels,” listing eight numbered conceptual strata with a subnote for “Ontological Ground” under “Modes of Belief.”  
- **Image 3:** A lined page of four paragraphs discussing the guide’s focus on general conditions, defining the corporeal substrate, explaining corporeal agency in a Field of Agency, and stating that corporeal structure is taken as given a priori.

```

**Summary**  
These pages lay out the eight “Levels” that structure the guide—ranging from the physical (Corporeal Substrate) through psychological and interpretive layers (Subjective Agency; Modes of Awareness; Modes of Belief; Text Model Interpretation; Judgements of Objective Models; Practical Banter) up to the epistemological fringes (The Known, the Unknown, the Unknowable). The author then emphasizes a methodological stance: to frame each reader’s unique conditions against these general levels, defining **corporeal substrate** as any physical medium supporting consciousness, and **being corporeal** as the capacity to act within a world of bodies—a field of agency. Finally, they note that the bodily and sensory world is treated as a given a priori, with human beings inherently instantiated as corporeal agents.

```

**Summary**  
These pages expand on the guide’s core concepts in three parts. First, they further the analogy of **text** as an extra sensory organ—likened to a photon—that delivers an experience requiring the reader’s active evocation, subtly recalibrating their state of being. Second, they introduce an eight-step **Levels** framework, ranging from the physical **Corporeal Substrate** through **Subjective Agency**, **Awareness**, **Belief** (with an ontological ground), **Text Interpretation**, **Objective Model Judgements**, **Practical Banter**, to the **Known/Unknown/Unknowable**. Third, the author clarifies the guide’s focus on the most general conditions, defines the **corporeal substrate** (the body or any future substrate hosting consciousness), characterizes **being corporeal** as acting within a Field of Agency, and asserts that the structure of this corporeal substrate is treated a priori.

- **Image 2:** A lined page titled **“Levels”**, listing eight numbered conceptual strata, with “Ontological Ground” indented under “Modes of Belief.”  
- **Image 3:** A lined page of four paragraphs discussing the guide’s focus on general conditions, the nature of the corporeal substrate (including potential computer hosts), corporeal agency in a Field of Agency, and the a priori treatment of the body and world of sense and measurement.

**Summary**  
These pages enumerate eight “Levels” that form the structure of the guide—from the physical foundation (Corporeal Substrate) through interpretive and evaluative layers (Subjective Agency; Modes of Awareness; Modes of Belief; Text Model Interpretation; Judgements of Objective Models; Practical Banter) up to the limits of knowledge (The Known, the Unknown, the Unknowable). The author then shifts to methodology, emphasizing a vantage on general conditions before personal specifics, defining “corporeal substrate” as any physical medium sustaining consciousness, clarifying “being corporeal” as agency within a field of bodily action, and treating the sensory–measurable world as an a priori given for all human agents.

**Summary**  
These pages first reconceptualize **text** as an added sense organ—comparable to a photon—that carries a unique experiential “truth” to each reader and, in turn, subtly recalibrates the reader’s present state of being. Next, the author lists eight **Levels** structuring the guide, from the physical foundation (Corporeal Substrate) through interpretive and evaluative stages (Subjective Agency; Modes of Awareness; Modes of Belief; Text Model Interpretation; Judgements of Objective Models; Practical Banter) up to the epistemic boundaries (The Known, the Unknown, the Unknowable). Finally, a methodological note emphasizes attending first to these general conditions before personal specifics, defines “corporeal substrate” as any physical medium supporting consciousness, describes “being corporeal” as agency within a field of bodily action, and treats the sensory–measurable world as an a priori given for all human agents.

```

**Summary**  
The first page reimagines **text** as an extra sense organ: each reading deepens and integrates an experiential “truth” and subtly recalibrates the reader’s present being. It then likens text to a **photon**, carrying experience that only actualizes in a particular subject’s context. The second page enumerates eight **Levels** structuring the guide—from the physical substrate through interpretive, evaluative, and pragmatic layers to the epistemic limits—and follows with a methodological note: the guide prioritizes these general conditions before personal specifics, defines the **corporeal substrate** (any medium hosting consciousness), explains **being corporeal** as agency in a bodily action field, and treats the sensory–measurable world as an a priori given for all human agents.

**Graphic Elements**  
A faint, colored concentric-ring diagram bleeds through the left margin of both pages, visually anchoring the conceptual “Levels” and textual reflections within its radial structure.

## Entry 243: Campsite Coding Adventure
*Date: 2025-07-04*

**2 June, 2025**  
PDT - 12:34 p.m.  
121 Days since 1 Feb 2025  
23,694 Days old  
= 13 * 1823

I'm at my campsite in Northern California under Mount Shasta which looms above me, only somewhat behind some tall pines. Hildy is sleeping, napping. A Ruby the Rav4 that got us here — some 2900+ miles since leaving our Hudson Valley home just 6 days ago on this cross-country vacation. It was only yesterday we decided to enter California on route US-395, travelling from just outside Salt Lake City through Utah and Nevada on Interstate 80, then turning north on 89 (hey, maybe that’s Redding City?) at Mount Shasta by 9:00. Tomorrow our first campsite reservation starts, and we’ll be camping amongst the redwoods, on the “Avenue of Giants.”

It’s been a while since I took out a notebook and just wrote. I’ve been having conversations with large language models and even more lately doing coding — “lil’ bc” coding with them, to have software that can take my earlier conversations and... well process them, help me search through them, summarize them… somehow take those conversations along with my notebooks, old papers, old notes of all sorts, and ultimately find me the “best parts, yeah,” I think that’s what I think I’m doing. Hmm...

**continued...**

It’s a puzzle I’m working out. That’s what my notebooks have always been. A puzzle I’m trying to put together. I have ideas about things that seem important, so I start writing words. They give me sentences that remind me of those thoughts — and I like to think the words are so clear that anyone who understands my language will equally be able to at least understand the sentence and so know that thought. With a few sentences, a few paragraphs, a series of thoughts builds into a meaningful idea, and with a few paragraphs, an insight into some subject has been distinctly preserved. In most theories of language, this preservation of an insight by any subject, given the preservation of the text, perhaps suitably translated from language to language is eternal. An insight thus becomes timeless and atomic in its existence.

But of course I know the more clearly I state it and the more clearly I state anything, that this cannot be ultimately true. This truth, like any insight, like anything capable of being contemplated requires assumptions. It requires conditions. It requires context, expression, and a circumstance, a moment of discourse.

**Continued...**

I’ve learned a lot from talking to AI, but the most important things — the timeless, precious, priceless thoughts — are within me. It’s the stepping back, reading back the responses that I get after asking the chatbot to organize what I’ve said, to summarize, to clean up and restate what I was feeling inadequate at describing, unable to clearly explain to myself for years, that I understand — not that the language models know something that I don’t — but that what I knew all along can be expressed in a way that is clearer in words that nearly fit self… or perhaps patience — to organize so clearly, or completely.

So what I’m learning that is so important is that I did know these things all along but I didn’t have the clarity to fall back on, or the eloquence to have confidence in the feeling that I did get it… whatever it is… or was...

I want to believe in wisdom that I have never been able to state. But now, with those statements which resonate with my inner wisdom… have I gained some wisdom? or have I lost the seed of maintaining the wonder of ineffability?

When we ask a question, we are generally looking for meaning in the form of a narrative answer. However, words are not meaningful. Words are not containers of meaning. They are not containers at all. They have the ability to evoke meaning only when presenting to a mind that can place the word used in a context which has been meaningful to them in the past. It is the mind that recognizes the word which evokes meaning from their current context, and the discourse they understand as why the words are being encountered.

Meaning is more than words. Life, like my life, is meaningful to me, whether I am thinking of naming the content of my thoughts or not. For example, as I sit in my car, writing these words, there is a mosquito buzzing around me. I try several times to swat with my hand against the window beside me and finally manage to catch it with a clap of my two hands. There are few or no words in my head as I do this, even as I’m writing through the narrative I’m forming on this page that either helps me toward my goal of removing the threat represented by the mosquito — but there is significant meaning to the success of my mission — to me.

Consciousness is a container, in that all experience, all of my experience, which is the only experience I have access to, is contained in my consciousness. This container of consciousness holds the immediate experience — which in reflection I might label as "Now" — but this immediate now contains both what I am recalling as what has been, and what I anticipate as what is to come.

As the immediate experience, the container of consciousness resolves a personal horizon, which I would describe in a narrative to another person as my subjective world. It is within this idea of consciousness as a container which I label my subjective world that I can understand and distinguish a part of this world — the objective world — that is, the models of a physical world, of a political world, of a scientific empirical world, of a social and emotional world. I can distinguish many labels referring to various aspects of this objective world, but there is no question that all of these models which I think of as outside of me are contained in my subjective world, and so within my pre-reflective indisputable consciousness.

---

While I use the models learned from narratives learned through a life of interactions with the people and media, and with experience I have had directly through my physical encounters with my body and the world around me... there is another world which is outside of my subjective world, and also not included in the models I can make of a physical world. That is the corporeal world, which is the world which is present to my senses, which can be recorded by my instruments. It is the empirical world before there can be a model of it. My experience as reduced to only what [scribbled out] is immediate. It is the corporeal instant. It is the self entangled with non-self, such that there is no distinction. This is my lifeworld. Husserl's Lebenswelt.

The corporeal world is a conceptual extrapolation of a wider world which can only be experienced one conscious mind at one Now. And if we understand the subjective world as contained in consciousness, and the objective world as contained in the subjective world of one person, then the corporeal world is the world that [scribbled out]

is touched by the subjective world but only through a corporeal Embodiment.

**The Nature of Narrative**

In my notebook, to express an idea, my tool is primarily words forming sentences, and those sentences presented serially in paragraphs. This is the form or the narrative construct to express and organize some set of ideas that I have in my mind that I have an intention of saving so that I can recreate these ideas for myself and hopefully, but less certainly, offer them in a form that other people can use to recognize these same ideas. This form is called a narrative. Whether I am writing or speaking, the ideas are not contained in the form. We depend on a reader or listener recognizing the expressions and recreate them into the sentences, paragraphs, and organize them to understand my intended ideas.

Narrative is not a formal system. Rather, it is an informal manner of allowing a specific vocabulary of words usually understood as a specificity of language, to form expressions which can be recognized as a specific intended meaning. However, the lack of formalization in interpretation means every reader or listener has some personal degree of flexibility in understanding the actual meaning. While there could be conscious intention to take an expression in a certain way, usually the understanding is automatically a reflexive, implicit understanding of meaning.

So maybe the serial narrative *does* have important utility… just perfection in translation from ideas and absolute modeling of corporeality is not available as such. I would note, in that case, that the problem with the serial narrative form is not in the narrative, but in the belief that expressions are more than the utility that they bestow. That the meaning they *evoke* is something which can be “True” in any absolute sense. Rather, at best, narrative is useful, now.

While there could be conscious intention to take an expression in a certain way, usually the understanding is automatically a reflexive, implicit understanding of meaning.

---

Formal systems aspire to higher standards of reproducible rigor than informal narrative, with postulates, proofs, definitions and standards defined through intersubjective institutions. Still, the form is one of symbols and words forming serial expressions which must be perceived and understood to evoke a meaning in the mind of a reader. The target idea in the mind of the writer is similarly subtly adjusted by the iterative process of creating the formal expression. The resulting written form of the formal expression often corrects or perhaps falsifies an idea which the writer is working out. Further, a translation of the formal expression can be expressed in informal language, interpreted for those who are not schooled in the specifics of the meaning of the formal system.

Both the formal and informal systems of expression are limited by various attributes. Transmission of meaning is still dependent on a shared context between writer and reader. The informal system is more flexible in the ability to make up words — whether as compound words or phonetic constructions which may mimic sounds the writer assumes the reader may have heard or may reference shared but unexpressed cultural touchstones.

---

Both systems are strictly limited by the time available for cognition to evoke the meaning of a sentence or equation, for instance. A sentence cannot be arbitrarily complex in scope as well, and the constituent words or symbols need to be clear and distinct enough from one another to work in the target context.

Note that in these cases we’ve been talking about the use case of formal and informal expression has been to take thoughts, project them from a mental idea into a specific serial narrative or formal expression, then compare them to that mental idea for some degree of congruence. For the writer, this is how an idea can be translated from an internal conception into a serial form which will facilitate recalling the idea in the future. For the reader, the comparison is starting with the serial expression, and evolving a facsimile of what the reader’s understanding of the words and symbols perceived suggest.

---

The open question I would like to now address is whether either formal or informal systems can be used to express models of “the world.”

I am writing in my notebook, sitting beside a campfire which I built in a large metal fire pit, in my campsite in a redwood forest in Northern California. In the context of models of the world, the building and maintaining of a fire safely requires a model of what a fire is, what it needs to be maintained, and how it can be maintained safely, so the fire does not spread to the delicate and vulnerable forest all around me.

To categorize this model, an idea or perhaps understood as a set of ideas which together constitute a model, it includes both scientific principles like combustion (chemistry), material science (wood, paper, air), fluid science (airflow), thermodynamics (temperature: even gravity — cold air is heavier than warm air, gravity creating lift in response to heating — with the possibility of embers being carried on currents out of the pit into the forest).

---

Beyond the science, the actions I take to build, maintain and control the fire are engineering. With intention I am finding and judging twigs to start the fire, stirring coals to maintain the fire, judging whether I need to add a fresh piece of the wood bundle I bought to keep the fire going without making it too large. I am also judging how close I can sit to have the smoke of the fire drive away the mosquitoes but not so close that the smoke irritates my eyes, as I continue writing about these ideas in my notebook.

As a writer I like to imagine my thoughts are the same as the words on the page I’ve just written. I aspire to capture the important points, the essence of the intention which motivated me to pick up the pen and paper and start jotting down letters to form words, sentences, paragraphs. But on reflection, I recognize that the thoughts I have while writing are far more varied, even scattered, than the words that I carefully form on the page. Further, as I re-read the words I’ve been writing, my thoughts change, my ideas develop. I think of examples which I’d like to include, concepts which may help explain, and ambiguity and misleading phrases which may distract from one critical point or another that I am aspiring to make crystal clear.

Has the subject of my writing changed? Has the topic evolved? Well it depends on what I mean by those words. I want to consider in this writing session the nature of narrative, informal or formal, and whether such a form is able to articulate a model of the world. This is difficult first because it is circular: in that the thesis I wish to evaluate is also the mechanism I must use to accomplish the expression of the idea… and I’ve already determined that the act of composing the expression influences the idea being expressed… for better or worse. In noting the science I wish to focus on a model of the world to which I am investigating, I’ve also realized in all practical cases the idealized model building of the ideas in my mind is conditioned on the engineering of my empirical interactions with any world I am aspiring to understand and model. Even distinguishing how much is the science of modelling and where the engineering of observations and experiments biases and limits what can be known is a concern.

---

I’ve sat here next to my little fire, looking at the end of that last sentence considering where to go next. Clearly, to me, narrative is inadequate to convey or create comprehensive models of “the world” — whether internal models of a subjective world, conceptual models of an objective world, or a model of a corporeal world to which we are casually connected. It is inadequate to record a comprehensive personal account of such a model, and demonstrably more inadequate to convey such a model to a different person or some other type of being.

Yet it is literally all we have, and from a practical viewpoint it does convey many practical ideas in many useful categories. While not purely scientific, the practical engineering that can be codified in formal and informal ways has bestowed untold power on human beings going back some millions of years… including tools like fire and much more recently, writing.

**An Irrational Belief in Rationality**

In the modern era, logical arguments have replaced articles of faith in deities for the most part. Beliefs that were common and accepted by large percentages of a culture’s population or supported by accredited academics have been overturned by precise and verifiable logical proofs and detailed empirical experiments with precise apparatus, at least as long as those methods can be reproduced and verified.

However, the difficulty in precise expression through narratives previously uncovered, open a limit on how closely an individual can believe that a narrative they may know word-for-word can be either understood exactly as the writer intended, or how applicable it may be to a particular person’s subjective experience. Rationality may not be enough.

I’ve been considering the analogies to mathematics as early as the Greeks. Euclid and Pythagoras found through careful analysis that whole numbers and rational numbers were not enough. Simply measuring the sides of right triangles uncovered an inconvenient relation in the form of √2, simply drawing a right angle with equal opposite and adjacent sides. The hypotenuse was provably not a rational number. Pythagoras' Theorem is not closed with regards to rational numbers. The real numbers are required.

The discovery of the utility of the square root of negative one further addressed more necessary cases where the reals were not closed, but opened more bags of proverbial worms.

Narrative, aside from the philosophical issues so far explored, has more cases where seemingly logical deductions offer plausible arguments and compelling metaphors, but using them can be fraught with inconsistencies, false metaphors, and fuzzy logical equivalences.

Hilary and I are sitting at the picnic table in our campsite at Hidden Springs Campground, in the Humboldt State Forest, Northern California, on the Avenue of the Giants. She’s making a colorful “thank you” sign for the staff. I’m writing about it in my notebook, contemplating what a great time we’re having, just a week and a half into our four-week road trip adventure and Redwood vacation.

Yet, while I’m enjoying this rare and wonderful time with Hilary, I’ve been seeing pictures on Facebook, which has been keeping me informed about the political crisis boiling over in Southern California, riots in Los Angeles in response to ICE raids taking people into custody, escalating by the day.

What I want to be thinking about, and writing about in these journal entries, are the fundamental questions of philosophy, consciousness, human existence and the fundamentals of being itself. To have riots in LA just a few hundred miles from where I’m sitting in such peaceful quiet — hearing the occasional crow and ravens in the distance and the soft brush strokes of Hilary applying water to her watercolor drawing — is as ironic as it is heart-wrenching.

---

There is something wrong here, meaning in my experience of the world. Is it something wrong with my view of an external world? Is it my experience of my subjective world? Is the problem with my idea of what *should* be, rather than the way the world “really” is?

Or, is the problem with the assumption that writing out questions, answers, statements, pronouncements, expressions — or speaking — or thinking in narrative has anything to do with anything, other than occupying my conscious attention for some length of time?

*What’s the point?*

**More June 8th 2025**

I took a nap earlier this evening. I’m not sure what I dreamed about. Matt Parker, the “Standup Maths” YouTube guy may have been in it, or that may have been last night, but when I woke up, I was thinking about using second differences of prime numbers to create a key that can be used to decode messages.

This is a speculation in progress, but I want to be able to supply a minimal amount of information, along with an encoded message (we’ll start with a text message as an example) that the information can decrypt.

Suppose I just supply a prime number, perhaps a 2K (2000 or 2048 bit prime). I’ve previously considered giving a prime and a count of the number of consecutive primes and use attributes of those consecutive primes, such as the sequence of second differences, or the relative abundance of each second difference in the sequence to make assignments of letters to numbers which would encode and decode the numbers. The receiver would need to be able to create the sequence of second differences (or already have in a library of such sequences).

---

When I woke from my nap, I wondered if I could use a different way of creating the cypher. How about just one prime is given without a count? Using the second difference, or second ratio, use the number of characters in the cypher and find a sequence of consecutive primes with the same SD or SR (or both??) and encode the letters with the distance of each prime from the initial prime.

I realize this isn’t really a safe cypher scheme regardless of how the cypher is made. If each letter uses the same code, it can be rather easily cracked like a crypto menu. But I wanted to think how this base could be built upon.

**A Guide to the Subjective World**  
*A written roadmap to The Algorithms of Text Through Agency.*

There are many subjects, but there is only one you, the person reading these words and understanding them. My goal in these pages is to help you, the person reading, understand your perspective on the world as built from some conditions of Being, Agency, Awareness, belief, and conceptions of Models described in text, and judgments.

This is not a description of a Being living in a corporeal world. Ideally, the specifics of the subject are essentially unknown and unknowable by any Being other than the Subject Being, which is always only you.

---

Being is just what it is to be you, moment to moment. Exactly that, nothing more. In this sense, Being, as the verb of “To Be,” it is the “is”-ing of “is.”

Subjects exist in corporeal packages, and could be anything, but it must be something interacting with a surrounding corporeal world with presumably other corporeal Beings which can interact through some corporeal mode.

The focus of this guide is a phenomenological investigation and guide to the structure of Being a Being with a body with agency in a world of interactions among many levels of Text, turning to a specific perspective on all of the ways we are focusing on stories, and judgments of stories that distort a subject’s balanced awareness of specificity, the limits to the usefulness of text, and how a bias towards distortion (deconstruction) is its only utility.

---

The only assumption I make is that you can understand the words you are reading.

As a subject, your awareness of your corporeal world presents clues to your senses about what is real.

As a reading subject, text adds not only the field of a new source of patterns of how much attention there is in the brain to recognize and understand words and symbols, it also brings a new kind of time sense. Text is dealing with content that happened or is scheduled to happen at almost any time but now. This is the clear distinction with all of the other senses which are all composited together in our awareness of Now as what our senses show us is what the world seems like at the moment, and who I am now, it is the “me” it takes to notice what Now is.

---

An understanding of Text as an additional sense organ makes it clear to me that text is channeled into a deeper, integrated experience of truth about each sensorially experienced text encounter — and as the meaning of the new encounter is evoked by the reading, the present state of Being is, as a whole, recalibrated, even if only very slightly.

The actual text of anything is like the photon. It carries an experience to the reader but the reader must evoke what it means, and it will always be an experience which only manifests in the context of one specific subject at a time. This is a guide for the subjects.

**Humanizer —**  
Fully understand the  
Subjective Corporeal Agent Being  
that I am.  

That all Beings Are  
And set intentions for my Being  

that are balanced between  
Intending actions which are  
For the Benefit of All Beings.  

Including Myself  
Those Beings Like Me.  

And to approach all Beings  
as Agents, striving to maintain the  
dance of homeostasis.  

**The Guide to Subjective Agency**

---

I want to keep the focus of the  
Guide to be on the most general  
conditions, to put your specific  
conditions in perspective for what is  
possible, what are the most balanced  
perspective to know what I am and  
what that means for me.

The Corporeal substrate means my  
body — but maybe there will be truly  
conscious computers sooner or later —  
the consciousness is still happening  
in a confined area made up of  
some corporeal substrate, biological,  
electronic, or whatever.

Being Corporeal means being able to  
interact in the corporeal world as an agent  
which is interconnected in the field of  
Corporeal Action — this is a Field of  
Agency.

How the Corporeal is structured is a  
very different topic. We will here  
take the corporeal body and the corporeal  
world of sense and measurement as  
a Given. A Priori. Human beings  
are born corporeal agents in a  
Field of Agency.

---

Intention is the rudder of the  
subjective agent. The flow of now is a  
mode of awareness guided by the various  
levels of attention in the mind of the  
subject.

Habits develop as underlying certainty  
about how the corporeal world works.  
These include many ideas that are  
learned as stories, conveyed by people  
who also convey their opinions on the  
matter.

---

**Visualize the structure of your  
awareness of Now. This moment.**

Not in words, but in the categories —  
starting with a simple individual  
agent to an agent that can both  
act in the world and read and write  
stories about agents at different  
times, in different places, even in different  
languages.

**Guide for the Curious Subjective Agent**

Our flow of experience is always only as a corporeal subjective being. While corporeal observations can be made of the interactions between any subjective agents through corporeal organ sensors, the experience of the agent and our consciousness when self-reflected allows a deep influence. Once the structured landscape of eidetic objects is learned, it begins to appear to be quite distinct from both the corporeal world that I can experience through my senses, and which I understand through personal habits and models of how I think the world works, is the interpretive field of some corporeal substrate that supports our page of mind. I can see the evidence and logic in cause and effect. What we infer from our senses as a distinct object in my world, it fashions in my model of the world, which backs my instantaneous reactions to new sense impressions.

I think of text as a sense, but in addition it allows sensations at times that are not now. With the creation of text, a chronology can be recorded and new information added later, so the moment of now can be used to plan the future, and to memorialize.

Stories far predate writing, but text used the structures of language to create new structures in the subjective agent that are understood in the world more and more as an objective word, in which the main goal was to imagine yourself in your subjective perspective on the world as practically insignificant — that what people are supposed to do to want to be anyone is to do something so significant that *everyone* knows your name.

Yet the objective world doesn’t really exist at all. It is a set of ideas that each individual only knows what they have read or seen… but yet make judgments — good or bad — on ideas about the world as a whole based only on what I think I know, what I’ve heard, and whose words I trust.

It is difficult to understand the nature of text in a subjective way. This is a critical point but one made particularly difficult to express clearly and unambiguously because of the structure necessary for a subjective agent to read text and in so doing, constructing in my own model of the world my eidetic object of what I understand the words to mean, along with an unwritten but assumed truth by the writer and the reader, when propositions and is understood in the context of an objective world. Not the corporeal world of sense and measurement, but the subjective was reduced and latent in each moment’s encounters with the sensible world, which evoke the latent models relevant to the sense data.

Text, which includes all media as well, defines in its practical repeatability a new world which few Beings are even aware of because it is awareness completely abstracted and disconnected from the corporeal or subjective worlds. The Objective World is a way of thinking as if there was one world common to everyone, verifiable through the use of text simulated and...

A body is a corporeal containment in which humans find themselves in. No one asks you which container you will spend a life in. Circumstances choose, and you are the self-identified person, noticing you are a person with a name, a language, and — if you’re lucky — a family, a few friends, a class, a club, maybe a tribe or two.

A set of circumstances created the corporeal human being in which the body realizes pretty early along the way how to ask the basic question about being here and now.

Here and Now are like Space and Time, but as reduced to the way in which the geometric sense is experienced in our conscious integration of the senses and the eidetic model of the world and all that is in it, this is the Noema, the wordless, instantaneous essence of what I know of something is stored. However the corporeal substrate seems fit, but the subjective world is experienced as the eidetic mind objects, informed and informing the conscious acts, focusing attention between our sense impressions and our eidetic meaning.

Now is the flow of moments. The mind has many associated and disassociated awareness threads. Now tends to be experienced one moment at a time, but they manifest in consciousness in the appropriate way to consider the content, the experiences which are summed up and progressively compiled into the Current Agent Subjective Model.

We live in the conscious moments of our corporeal human. This guide aspires to give you tools to uncover the structure of Agency as a Subjective Human Being.

We will first consider the very Basic Beings. Then we consider what language adds to the power, but what is lost that was easier without it?

Then we need to pay particular attention to Text.

## Entry 252: Theory of Narrative
*Date: 2025-07-24*

**Narrative Mind and the Text**

What I need is a Turing Complete understanding of Narrative. Under an objective and subjective perspective.

_Civilization is built on Narrative._

A theory of Narrative starts with the basic definitions of what Narrative is, but we also must immediately recognize that we are using the narrative form to inscribe the scribe’s thought translated (projected) through the writer’s persona, namespace and language using words and expressions with an intention to *evoke* thoughts, images and feelings in a target audience.

So in this sense, to credibly offer a theory of Narrative, one must first be clear about the perspective I take, and the perspective I recommend all readers of this narrative at least temporarily hold and then. Specifically they must consider the objective world, which is all of the cultural knowledge shared in books, media, 2nd hand words which must be digested by the senses and recreated in the meaning of the subjective world of each reader, one at a time.

This can be taken further, considering that the lived experience is consciousness, one moment at a time, which is the perspective of the being we are. Somehow corporeality supports beings, and we know this because we are aware of movement and we’re these cells of time and space in which to notice how the world works. Every being lives moment to moment, in that moment of being may experience a memory from the past, reminded of it somehow perhaps. In that moment a being may expect the future, make plans, consider if the future ideas may require action now. But I am always now. And I am always flowing, as the wake of a ship, plowing through the empty fluid sea of time.

It is in the imagination of the Subjective Being that they notice the *coherence* of that flowing time. It is more than time apparently, because I can see things, I can hear things, I can smell things, touch them, taste them. A Sentient Being can make detailed sense of what all those senses mean about their world, they build a practical map in their Mind and identify how they should plan and do certain things.

Human Beings have gone beyond simply using their own 1st person senses to ground their subjective understanding of the world in an objective model of how the surroundings work, who I am and what it all means to me. Now it is language, culture, science, history and countless narratives from these and every category. And human beings are creating more and more narratives… and more often than not fighting about these narratives, literally to the death of far too many.

Human Being refers to everything we are. But let’s be clear, this is a subjective perspective. This cannot be understood about some other human being. This narrative is focused on the reader noticing the nuance of the flow of time as visible in the reading of each sentence.

In my mind, reading acts like an internal sense like a combination of seeing, hearing, touching etc. but projected on a screen showing me things that happened in the past, that may happen in the future, or just some…

## Entry 253: Theory of Narrative
*Date: 2025-07-24*

_Way this works is: it is giving you an experience, but it points back to some other time, some other space._

The time and space of text is different than the embodied time and space of our subjective world. Text allows the establishment of a time and space reference which is outbound from the subjective use of power, memory & consciousness. Text creates the Objective World but only in the subjective Mind.

Now, imagine that we want to divide the world into 2 abstractions. Everything must be either one thing or another.

**The Dialectic** is

**Text**  
_Not the words on the page._  
But the meaningful text evoked in people’s minds when they read or hear or recognize a narrative

**Vortex**  
_Everything Else._  
The Corporeal World, the body, consciousness and all it does…  
_Except for Reading_

# Theory of Narrative

## 1) Subjective Ontology

We have no evidence that there is an objectively observable physical corporeality. All evidence that can be sensed or measured is empirically only accessible through subjective Beings.

Being may always be a subjective Experience.

2) The narrative is distinct from the words through which it is expressed. The narrative in this case is the understood narrative in the experience of the reader (or target subject).

3) The *Meaning* is a transformation on the Reader's current base state of Being to the After-reading state.

4) A person can only process one narrative at a time.

# Theory of Narrative (Page 2)

Narrative is the form used to convey the social glue of civilization.  
Beliefs are always ultimately beliefs in narrative.

Narrative exists in many forms and used, usually without being named, but all narratives have a story, a perspective on the story, an arc of action, the resolution, the lesson or ultimate essence of the narrative.

The form of a newspaper story is well reviewed and analyzed and might be a useful model for narratives.

Science papers are narratives.  
Other media still conveys narratives.  
People tend to decide immediately whether they believe or not in a narrative.

There is social pressure to judge narratives.  
School is fully presented through narrative.
