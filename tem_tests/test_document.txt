Quantum Consciousness and the TRM Framework

This is a test document for the Humanizer application. It explores how quantum mechanics can be applied to understanding consciousness and subjective experience.

The Tetralemma Reading Method (TRM) uses density matrices and POVM operators to represent the measurement of semantic states. When we read text, we construct a quantum-like representation that captures the inherent ambiguity and mixed states present in language.

Key concepts:
- Density matrices (ρ) represent mixed quantum states
- POVM operators allow for generalized measurements
- The tetralemma provides four-fold logic: A, ¬A, both, neither
- Verification loops ensure transformations move in the intended direction

This framework bridges the gap between formal mathematical structures and lived subjective experience, making consciousness work computationally tractable while respecting its irreducible complexity.
