## Data Retrieval Method

This gallery was generated using **direct PostgreSQL queries** via SQLAlchemy.

### Why Direct Database Access?

- **Performance**: Bulk extraction without HTTP overhead
- **Flexibility**: Direct JSONB querying with `custom_metadata->>'gizmo_id'`
- **Efficiency**: Single query joins conversations, messages, and media
- **Use Case**: One-time data extraction for gallery generation

### Alternative: API Endpoint Access

For production integrations (like MCP server or AUI), we use HTTP API endpoints:
```
GET /chatgpt/search?query=...&author_role=assistant
GET /chatgpt/conversation/{uuid}
POST /chatgpt/conversation/{uuid}/render
```

**Benefits of API approach:**
- Authentication & rate limiting
- Clean separation (business logic in services)
- Caching layer
- Better for external integrations

**For this task:** Direct DB = faster, simpler, sufficient.

```
We've scratched as much as we could.

We're recently thought about less than we ever have in the history of our species, and therefore have been more caught up in it than ever before. We are also in the position for the first time in history to overcome the fundamental problem and turn this earth into a paradise of love, life and freedom for all. If we don't, we will evaporate into a dusty cosmic snowflake of death within fifty years. Maybe within twenty.

I'm for paradise.

Here's [scratched out] the problem what it does to us, how we can get rid of it forever, and life without it.

---

I must remember, at all times, that I am one of many, and many of one.

I am the unity of my experiences, all the experience of my unity.

I am the diversity of my memory, all the memory of my diversity.

---

Objects affect other objects. 

These effects can only be noticed by Dasein.

They are also produced by Dasein.

---

The object is the unity of all knowledge.

The object of understanding.

The unity, is in the moment.

Projection of the understanding into other moments is a translation into the new understanding of the new moment.

The pre-intellectual awareness, without wordy thoughts, chopping up the undifferentiated reality.

I've been carrying this notebook around with a specialized title but nothing in it, so here I am, on a plane for the first time in... 13+ years... with Molly flying up to Burlington Vermont to see Corrin, and I feel like explaining to myself what it is I had in mind regarding "A Consciousness First Ontology".

Ontology is the study of Being, Being is the action of existence. It also can refer to a being, which is the subject of experiencing existence. That is, a Being experiencing Being. Ontology, then, is what a Being does when it considers existence in general, or its own (life in particular).

In another sense, ontology is an unconscious, or perhaps subconscious, awareness of the characteristics of existence.

The word is experienced through the filter of consciousness, what we know of the world arrives in moment of experience, which can only be sensed by consciousness itself through the implicit ontology of a specific subject.

At the core of our consciousness is a unifying oneness. Beyond that, consciousness is an existential stand in a physically interactive manifold.

Is There a Plan in Consciousness?

There is an astounding number of notions, hypotheses, and theories about what exactly consciousness is, so the need to explain and explore what I think the most intricate as well of the word about meaning used in texts and commentaries, see...

Consciousness is first and foremost personal. You, faithful reader, are the being that at this moment is conscious. If you are reading these words, or if they are being read to you, that is your text-speech nexus. It's your text processing consciousness that reads the meaning of those words against the backdrop of your personal time-horizon.

But text consciousness recognizes words we translate, them into personal memories and build the past of consciousness. Each sense is a kind of consciousness, each emotion can evoke a particular mode of consciousness.

Ontological Investigations

Ontology is the study of Being itself. The field of study designated as the field of ontology is lived experience. One can speak abstractly about other people's experience of Being, and use language to make broad generalizations about groups of people and their ontological experiences and opinions, but the approach used is used here is focused on the writer of this text and the reader, you.

There is something very important about you reading this relative to how to specify exactly what possible the Writing Being we are talking about. The writer and the reader create an ontological partnership for the duration of the text. For the writer they are considering perhaps one, perhaps a few people who will read their words.

Consciousness is first and foremost personal. You, faithful reader, are the being that at this moment is conscious. If you are reading these words, or if they are being read to you, that is your text-speech nexus. It's your text processing consciousness that reads the meaning of those words against the backdrop of your personal time-horizon.

But text consciousness recognizes words we translate, them into personal memories and build the past of consciousness. Each sense is a kind of consciousness, each emotion can evoke a particular mode of consciousness.

Ontological Investigations

Ontology is the study of Being itself. The field of study designated as the field of ontology is lived experience. One can speak abstractly about other people's experience of Being, and use language to make broad generalizations about groups of people and their ontological experiences and opinions, but the approach used is used here is focused on the writer of this text and the reader, you.

There is something very important about you reading this relative to how to specify exactly what possible the Writing Being we are talking about. The writer and the reader create an ontological partnership for the duration of the text. For the writer they are considering perhaps one, perhaps a few people who will read their words.

I've been carrying this notebook around with a specialized title but nothing in it, so here I am, on a plane for the first time in... 13+ years... with Molly flying up to Burlington Vermont to see Corrin, and I feel like explaining to myself what it is I had in mind regarding "A Consciousness First Ontology".

Ontology is the study of Being, Being is the action of existence. It also can refer to a being, which is the subject of experiencing existence. That is, a Being experiencing Being. Ontology, then, is what a Being does when it considers existence in general, or its own (life in particular).

In another sense, ontology is an unconscious, or perhaps subconscious, awareness of the characteristics of existence.

The word is experienced through the filter of consciousness, what we know of the world arrives in moment of experience, which can only be sensed by consciousness itself through the implicit ontology of a specific subject.

At the core of our consciousness is a unifying oneness. Beyond that, consciousness is an existential stand in a physically interactive manifold.

Is There a Plan in Consciousness?

There is an astounding number of notions, hypotheses, and theories about what exactly consciousness is, so the need to explain and explore what I think the most intricate as well of the word about meaning used in texts and commentaries, see...
